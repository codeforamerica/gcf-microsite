          In California, a state with one of the highest costs of living in the
          country, nearly one in five people live in poverty. CalFresh helps
          millions of California workers in low-paying jobs buy healthy food
          during a time of need. CalFresh doesn't only help an individual make
          it through a difficult time, but also energizes the local economy.
