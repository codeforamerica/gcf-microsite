  quotes:
  - Currently, I am on unemployment and receive about $230 a week from EDD. I have been using credit card debt to pay for things so that I have cash for my rent. I will be going back to substituting (teaching) in a few weeks which I did last school year. I made anywhere from $800 to $2800 a month with about 1K being the average.
  - I'm currently enrolled at UC Berkeley and my finances are very tight. I receive some money in grants and scholarships but I take out $5,000 in loans every year and I have to work part-time 10-15 hours/week. I've been doing this since my first year in college and I am now entering my final year. I come from a single parent, low-income household so I cannot ask my dad for financial help. My dad only makes $25-30K a year and he pays for health insurance, the mortgage on a house, utilities, and car expenses so I never wish to put a larger burden on him. I received EBT last year and it was extremely helpful. I was able to buy healthy groceries.
  - I just moved to California to get my teaching credential. I made and saved money over the summer, but it will be difficult for me to work as I have to do 15-20 hours of unpaid student teaching a week in addition to my classes. I still have to make loan payments, pay for insurance, gas, groceries, etc., in addition to the fees for tests to get my credential. I have no family support in California
  - I am doing a "year of service" for Habitat for Humanity and AmeriCorps. I will be building multi-family homes and tiny homes for lower-income families and the homeless. Because this is a service position I will only be provided with a very small living stipend (~$900 a month). I am a recent college graduate who just finished paying off their student loans and because of that, I don't have much money saved.
  - Applicant is disabled due to an undiagnosed disease so he hasn't been able to work for several months. Since he is undiagnosed, we also can't receive any extra help, nor can we afford to seek out medical treatment to get him the care he needs to get a diagnosis. We have done our best to keep our cost of living as low as possible but do have an additional $700 of expenses on top of the $1400 we spend on rent.
  - I was married when I came out of the closet. I couldn't get out of the marriage even though my wife long knew that I was gay so I went to my mom's. My mom couldn't accept me being gay, nor could my siblings. I left for the Bay Area. I originally planned to pay the bills driving for Uber, but my car was stolen. I have a new job, but need to wait two weeks before getting paid so I can buy basic things like food.
  - I'm struggling really bad, to the point of being in debt. I never have enough to eat. Ramen noodles, eggs, cereal everyday, just to save up money for bills. I've been going to the hospital to see what is wrong with me, but I believe I just need to eat properly. I'm almost 22 now, and I have another year of school. I honestly don't know how I will make it if I have no family here.
  - I am currently applying for grad school, which is extremely expensive. We are still living in Berkeley even though we both graduated. The rent is extremely high here and we receive absolutely no financial assistance from our parents. Since we graduated from UC Berkeley this past summer, we are also no longer receiving financial aid, which has significantly impacted our ability to support ourselves. We both now work in San Francisco and transportation to and from the city every day is quite costly. We are struggling to find the extra funds to feed ourselves after paying for rent, utilities, public transit, loans, grad school applications, and everything in between.
  - I do not receive any financial support from my father, and my mother works tirelessly in two jobs to feed my younger brother and to help me with college. I help my mom pay the water, light and gas bills for our apartment back in southern California, and I also pay the water, gas, and light bills for my apartment here in Berkeley. Our financial situation is not the best, and a CalFresh card would be a huge blessing and support.
  - I work twice a week, which is the most that I can work with my school schedule. Last semester was very hard. I would either have class all day, or have class and get off and work, or on weekends I would work. I did not have a single day off for 4 months straight to skim by. I would have to choose between eating or school supplies. This is affecting my mental and physical health. I hope that I can make this year better, and be excited for school, not dread it...
  - I'm in medical school and am taking out ~$33,000 in loans every four months. I'm spending more than half of my loan money on rent and utilities. Since I'm in medical school, I have to do volunteer work to gain more knowledge and skills in order to be the best doctor I can become. I have no time outside of this to work for money, or else I'd be jeopardizing my education. Because of the high cost of living in the Bay Area, I'm struggling to pay for groceries, basic living expenses, and car insurance so that I can get to and from the clinic I'm volunteering in at Martinez. I do not buy as much food as I need because of the expenses of living and the books/technology/transportation costs required for me to learn medicine.

  quotes:
  - I have been unemployed this last month. I am in the process of getting hired at an on campus job in university housing, though I have multiple applications out for more job opportunities. Although some of my schooling is covered through CalVet college fee waiver program, I am struggling to cover extra school fees and books. I am trying to further my future by earning a degree to one day be financially stable and available to help others in need.
  - This is my 2nd year at CSU Chico and during my first year I had no problems with money as my financial aid covered most of it, the rest was barely paid for by my parents. I found out last year after multiple visits to the financial aid office that for the rest of my education that I will not be getting almost any financial aid. It was for the reason that my parents just barely made the line of which to receive financial aid and so I ended up getting $750 (in grants) this year instead of the $12,000 (in grants) from last year. My dad works as a construction worker and it's only on certain weeks that he gets paid good which ends up making it like we have money but in reality, the pay is inconsistent. Anyways seeing this my parents and friends have told me to drop out but I really did not want to give up on college. I am looking for a job to help cover my expenses.
  - I lost my job because my car broke down and I could no longer get to it, as it was too far away. The place I had been living burned completely down last year in the Ponderosa fire, I lost everything I owned.
  - I am a full time college student with a 3.8 GPA. I currently have a job and have requested more hours because I'm struggling to pay rent. I have been getting sick due to living off cheap meals like ramen. I am not one to ask for things, but I am definitely in need.
  - New mother, baby is 7 weeks old. WIC food vouchers are mainly dairy foods and mother had to stop eating dairy while breast feeding due to milk intolerance in baby.
  - I am enrolled in online college classes. I just lost my job and am trying to look for another one right now. I only have $200 left in my account. That will only get me so much food and everything adds up. Getting CalFresh would be a huge help since I am on my own. My parents don't have money to help me.
  - After taxes, insurance, union dues, and retirement contributions, I only take home $1020 every two weeks. My rent is $1,200. I have worked all my life, never been unemployed, and never requested assistance before. I have been with Sheriff's Department and Probation for almost 25 years, and I still make the same amount I did when I started all those years ago. The price of everything continues to go up but my pay continues to go down. We struggle every month just to make it. I hate to ask for assistance, but I don't know what else to do.
  - I know I qualify for CalFresh and Medi-Cal, but with the fire I am running late collecting all the documents. I also am having a hard time reaching my county due to the emergency with fire. Need help with food asap. Thankfully, I've already gotten temporary Medi-Cal...

  quotes:
  - I need help with many basic day to today activities of daily living, because I'm disabled and have great difficulty getting things done. I'm currently suffering of rheumatiod arthritis, fibromyalgia, and seizures. I'm also suffering of a severly injured back and possible some other disease that is causing me great abnormal weightloss and extreme fatigue. I'm currently working with my PCP to figure out what is causing it.
  - I am on various medications for endometriosis, bipolar disorder, etc. The cost of my copays for medications has skyrocketed. It is really important to stay on my medications. But that has made it hard to buy food that I’m supposed to be eating. Trying to make $30 last a week for groceries makes it really hard to buy vegetables and fruit. I have gone down two sizes in a month because I have been balancing the cost of my medications against my purchases of groceries.
  - I just moved out of my single-mother's house. I still help her with bills and also try to pay my own rent and utilities with the little money I could provide. I can only afford to work part-time because I am also in school and in the ROTC program. I would be very grateful to have some help with being able to buy nutritious food instead of settling for quick, unhealthy food such as ramen and hot dogs.
  - I'm 18. I work 30 hours a week and I spend all my money on rent and on BART going to and from work.
  - I am a full time student with 2 part time jobs. I have been living off a small budget and student loans, but currently have a past due tuition balance and will not be able to afford groceries or rent after the month of October.
  - I'm unable to work because of medical reasons and I'm working on filing for medical disability.
  - I am earning my medical coding and billing certificate in order to work in a profession that I should be able to handle with my medical condition. My spouse is also working towards a new career in appliance repair and handyman services. We were both were living in Fairfield in October of 2017 when the fire hit and we were evacuated.
  - I'm hungry and am trying my best to hang in there. It's hard to work with no gas in my car, no food in my belly.
  - I was recently let go from my job, I have bipolar disorder and it was affecting my performance. I see a doctor now and I am trying to get the right medication and treatment. I have applied for SDI but haven't received anything yet.

  quotes:
  - I was a full time student last semester, will be a part time student this upcoming (summer semester) and if I still don't have a job in the fall will resume being a full time student. I am currently in the application process for summer internships. I'm staying in my ex-husbands house for a while, I am in the same house as my kids, but I don't have the funds to pitch in (and they are over 18). My daughter pays for my cell phone. The only bill I have is for my stuff in storage. I am saving  up money for my car which needs 980.00 in engine work and new brakes.
  - I'd like to be able to make healthier food choices which would improve my health and overall help me focus more on my academics and less on what I'll be eating everyday.
  - My boyfriend and I have been homeless for months. In January we were in a car accident that totaled $48,000. Following that I got extremely sick and couldn’t work so I was forced to quit. I was kicked out of my house at 17 in February and moved into my boyfriend's house after spending a week in a shelter. He has a fulltime job which barely makes ends meet. We often go to bed so hungry it's hard to sleep.
  - I started a long term substitute teacher position, but do not get paid until September 10th. I anticipate this amount to be $1,500 for the amount of time I worked in August. The hours for my sub job are irregular. I was not able to work June & July because school was closed. I am looking for a fulltime teaching job.
  - I'm 18, just started college, and living away from home for the first time. I only need help for a little while as I'm getting on my feet.

  quotes:
  - I became ill in Dec 2017 and am currently on unpaid company leave. I now only have Social Security retirement benefits. I live with my boyfriend and his mother. They are both disabled and his home care worker shops and provides their food from their disability and retirement income. I purchase my own food due to a special diet. I am having surgery next week and will be home several weeks to recover.
  - I was a registered nurse until I fractured my right heel bone and was forced to retire. Disability was declined. The only income I have is Social Security ($1,047 per month). Each month, my expenses average $75 for major medical insurance, $80 for one prescription medication, $54 for auto insurance, $30 for auto registration, $250 for propane for cooking and heating (I live in a camper). I do not have dental insurance and can't afford to get care for my bad teeth. I really need help for food and other basic necessities.
  - I'm 25 and I take care of my grandma who has been on dialysis for 11 years. I’ve helped her everyday for several years for free. It has become increasingly hard to support myself with very little money and hardly any family support. I go to local churches and food drives to get food for my grandparents and myself. Unfortunately, I find that many days and nights I go hungry. I am extremely independent; seeking help for others is easy. For myself, I have trouble accepting anything I don't feel I earned, but everyone needs a little help to get on their feet sometimes. I don't intend to take advantage of CalFresh services for an extended period. Only until I find a job that can allow me flexible hours while my grandma needs my continued support.
  - Just lost my job, already lined up a new job but it won't start for four months.
  - I will not be able to walk for five months due to a car accident. Need food badly.
  - I currently live with 3 other women from craigslist in a house. I am a student at Fresno State I did not receive financial aid this year. I have not had money for grocery shopping since last year. I have been living on fast food. I do get paid 12 dollars an hour but since I am going to school part-time am not able to work enough hours to get by.

  - All of my credit cards are maxed out and I do not know how I am going to buy food, pay my utilities or put gas in my car, let alone pay the rest of my bills this month. I am job hunting, but I have a child with autism and he only goes to an educational program for three hours a day.
  - I am living out of vehicles and sleeping on people’s couches. I have a severely debilitating handicap from my legs being snapped and twisted making it extremely difficult to stand or walk places. There is not enough income coming to pay rent let alone buy food. Looking for some stability.
  - I was a full time federal government employee until over a month ago. I am disabled with anxiety and bi-polar. I'm applying for disability. I expect us to have trouble with food expenses for the next few months.
  - I am currently employed, but will be out of work by the end of the week (9/14). I will be looking for new work, and will just need CalFresh to help with groceries until I am making enough to reasonably afford them again.
  - We were displaced from Paradise by the Camp Fire. We lost everything except for our vehicles and our pets. We lost our rental and all its contents, plus our workplaces burned down. We’re temporarily staying with family. We will be looking for work and a place to live… we just need some help for a little bit to get back on our feet.

  - I’m separated, going through divorce, not yet finalized. The ex-husband lost his job and I am looking for part-time work. I have two sons, both with ADHD, one with autism, and I spend a good amount of time parenting. Currently I just want to be able to feed them without building up debt on a credit card or depleting my savings account. My situation is embarrassing and humbling, but serious. If approved, I hope this will only be a temporary solution until I get on my feet, start a business, and rebuild my life.

  quotes:
  - My husband walked out on me and my two kids a couple months ago and filed for divorce a month ago. He is still paying the mortgage and utilities but barely any for food and has otherwise cut me off financially. I started college two years ago to become a nurse and am still in school. I have used up what little money I had to enroll in school and get my kids started back to school. I am trying to sort out my situation and have some family help but have urgent need for food assistance and expect that to be the case for some time as my husband says he's not helping any further and I have a few years before I will be able to become a nurse, and school prohibits me from working full time. I am not eligible for unemployment as I have been home raising kids all these years.
  - I spend the majority of my money on food in Marin. This is because my hourly wage is so low in comparison to the cost of living. On top of it all, I am a wilderness first responder, and I work with youth outdoors as an environmental science educator. My job is to inspire hope, action, connection, and responsibility within our youth - however, my value is not reflected in pay, unfortunately - as teachers across America well know!

  quotes:
  - My unemployment ran out in April. I am under a one year lease. My son works where I used to work, and he has the only income for the family. The rent is all of our income. My other children are in college full time and there is no work-study this year. They are on grants for their academics through PELL and SEOG. I really want someone who can evaluate our situation and provide resources. Thank you.
  - Not sure if this helps at all. The last time I had to renew my CalFresh all I needed to do was to update and give some paperwork and I kept forgetting, just like I forget a lot of things and stress about them. I struggle from paycheck to paycheck and at times I do ask my parents for money or food especially because my daughter is growing and eating more. We do live in a low income housing and we qualify for the HEAP program for our PGE. I do go to the food bank when I can which is a big help but we still need help with other foods.
  - I was working full time at a large hotel in Monterey. I had good pay, but was offered a job at a local business for higher pay and Monday to Friday (since hotels are open 24/7, a Monday to Friday schedule seemed like a luxury). The hiring job asked me to put in my two weeks’ notice for my past job. I was already training for my new job when they called me and said the position wouldn't work out since they didn't have it in the budget. Now I'm unemployed and applying for jobs.
  - Our income is around $3,000 per month, but it gets expensive with credit card bills, auto insurance, gas, clothes, diapers, utility bills, repairing the old car, etc. At times we cannot keep up with affording food. So we spend $8 for four people on McDonalds or boiling potatoes with salt is what we have to do to survive.
  - I have a car payment that's $336 every month and a weekly daycare bill of $175. After rent, the phone bill, and gas, I have nearly nothing to spend on food. I often don't eat so that my child can eat. I feel terrible feeding him cheap unhealthy food, especially because I enjoy cooking, but I can't afford the ingredients to cook anything. It's embarrassing, but I often eat leftover food at work or the school cafeteria so I have the energy to function. I would absolutely appreciate any help I can get.

  quotes:
  - Sheltered, with longtime friends. Unable to pay any rent, but help with their utilities when able. I pay for my cell phone only. I have not found fulltime work, despite a 4 year college business degree and 35 years of experience, since 2008. All resources meant for retirement have had to be used, and are depleted. Until last summer, I had paid all my bills on time for 35 years. Bankruptcy is scheduled next month. The car goes to repo tomorrow. I have HIV and am disabled depending on which social service or doctor you talk to, and am unable to get SSI. I am unable to get a job interview for full-time anything, all in my 50's. Well, it was damn good until 2008. Thank you for letting me vent a little. So glad I didn't have a mortgage, or children. I would have been a great dad.
  - I am the only one who takes care of my groceries, medical bills, CT scan test. I had to leave my job of 9 years as I became very ill with lung cancer, despite never having smoked. I now only have 1/2 of my right lung. I cannot work as I still struggle with this health issue. I have no income, used all my disability, and have exhausted my unemployment insurance. I am still disabled it has only been since August end of the month that I was released. I cannot pay my rent, copays for oncologist. After 3 hours of light activity I get very exhausted and my body aches. I have back lumbar pain and still recovering from two surgeries to remove the cancer. I am sure if I had money I could get food and that will boost my energy a little. I need help please. Right away I am hungry and need food.
  - I'm technically homeless, but make just enough money to pay for a bunk bed in a hostel for a few days at a time. My wallet was stolen and a replacement EBT card was sent to my mailbox in Pasadena, but I do not have the transportation to be able to retrieve it. My situation has drastically changed since I previously applied and I would like to be considered for an increase. I work during the day between 12:30pm and 4:30pm.
  - It still feels strange to have to skip 1-2 meals a day. I don't like to think of myself as the type of person that complains about their situation either. I will always do anything in my power to overcome adverse situations. By applying for CalFresh, I don't see myself as complacent, but attempting to take control of my situation and the cards life has dealt me.
  - I may be having to move in the next 1 to 4 weeks, depending on the grace of my landlord, otherwise I will be homeless. I have no family support at this time and no friends willing or able to help me. I have pop tarts and tomato soup and frozen burritos until I can get help from CalFresh. I have multiple physical and mental health challenges and doctor appointments each week.
  - We just recently moved to California and are struggling each month with enough money to properly buy groceries after rent, insurance, gas, utilities, and vehicle bills. I am pregnant which will make four in this household, and I am nervous we won't be able to buy enough food. We cannot afford childcare so I have to stay home with my children. I’m hoping we can get any kind of help there is available, even a little goes a LONG way.
  - I used to average 30-35 hours a week, but the last two months it's been fewer hours... last paycheck I grossed $275 for 22 hrs. I just need help for 6 months or less while we are in the slow period until work picks back up. Just worried about the coming months.
  - I was a caregiver for and lived with my dad who passed in 2016. I am disabled but am waiting to talk to a surgeon before I apply for SSI. I feel like I messed up the rest of my life so that my parents didn't have to go in nursing homes. I am so hungry.
  - I lost my job when the restaurant where I worked for 13 years was sold. My second job is less than 2 hours a day serving lunch at a school district and I don’t get paid during the summer break. My husband's second job is very variable. After deducting the medical, vision, and dental insurance for the five of us, and taxes, there's very little left my husband's paycheck.
  - I've had 3 back injuries this year. I work as a caregiver to the elderly in their homes. I go without pay when I take time off work or decline offered jobs from my agency due to my back injuries. I can only afford to eat once or twice a day and my health is declining. I buy most of my own food. I try my best not to eat the healthy foods that my parents buy or cook because my father is diabetic and my mother is pre-diabetic and they need healthy food for themselves.
  - I never thought I would ever apply for this help, but things started to quickly go downhill when I got a DUI two years ago. I had a great job working as a tank driver delivering fuel to gasoline stations. I paid big time for my bad decision. I lost everything. I lost my job and then my girlfriend left with our kids because I didn't have any income. I fell into a big depression... I just need a little help for a couple months as I'm already working on getting my Class A license again.
  - I am a sophomore in college paying for my own rent, tuition, food, books, and all other expenses. I receive no financial assistance from either of my parents because they are not capable of doing so while also maintaining financially stability themselves. I have to budget my spending on food especially. I have often skipped meals in fear that if I spend too much money on food I may not have enough funds to pay for rent.
  - I am currently in difficult financial bind- never been in a position such as now. Even help for one month would help my son and I immensely. I just started working my regular, consistent hours at the school. I was off during the summer and working our summer daycare for just about 3 hours a day except field trip days (1-2 times per week). I barely got by. I am almost embarrassed to be here, but hey, it happens, and I know I am not alone. First and foremost, my son needs to know that food will always be available.

  - I just finished a master's degree program for counseling, and I am in between jobs. I took a position with a counseling agency (non-profit), but I do not have an income yet. I am going on two weeks of no income, and I am really worried. I worked my entire life and have never been on assistance programs and I know this would be a temporary thing, but I need help especially as a single mom.
  - I'm homeless and I make 525 per month working 16 hours a week. Fortunately, I get to work when others call in sick.
  - I am looking for a new job and place to live with my kid. We had to move out of our house because my father-in-law got cancer. They can’t have a 5-year-old who gets sick all the time living in the house, and I don't know what we’re going to do.
  - I was living at a house owned by a church in Paradise. I haven’t had income in years, but had minimal financial assistance from family members. Now that the church is gone, I really have nothing. The house and all of my belongings are gone. The church didn’t have fire insurance either. I'm just trying to do whatever I can to stay afloat.

  quotes:
  - I am helping my adult son apply. He has a disability; he was diagnosed with mild intellectual disability when he was about 8. He had benefits, but when he became 18, they said he doesn’t qualify anymore. I disagree. I've been wanting to reapply for him but haven’t had the chance. Since we have moved to Sacramento, I haven't been able to work a steady job because of my disease. I can't afford to support my adult son because I also have two younger children that I support on my own. My son is crashing with family or friends, but doesn’t have a stable place to live. I try to take him food to eat when I can. I don’t know what else to do.
  - I have been working as an appraiser for 16 years, but since moving to Sacramento, I haven't been able to find work. A couple weeks ago, my annual software fees were due as well as my business insurance, and I was unable to pay. This has shut down my business. I am looking for work. I am selling things in order to survive on a daily basis. I anticipate this request for food stamps to be temporary. I look forward to getting back on my feet soon but some assistance, especially food assistance, would help immensely.
  - I really don't want to do this, but I need help. I just have to get through this to graduate.
  - Financially not making it. My landlord is about to begin eviction proceedings on me as my rent has been late every month. I struggle to get enough food for my home. I feed my kids before I feed myself. I recently ended up in the hospital from dehydration and malnourishment.
  - I am legally deaf due to a recent illness. A friend loaned me a hearing aid. I can only use phone on speaker. I am terrified of not getting medical treatment or having a place to live because of my income and disability status. I have been disabled for 30 years. A recent illness caused my condition to worsen. I need help.
  - I pay for wifi also and I take care of my emotional support dog Charlotte who is about 35 lbs. So any extra funds I have left goes to feeding and keeping her groomed. I can't walk to food pantries and such as they are too far. I get help from friends or neighbors with a hot meal here and there. I am starving almost after the first week after payday and I am becoming more unhealthy. I do not know what else to do. I am hungry now as I am typing this.
  - As I mentioned before, my father abandoned my family and I about 3 some-odd years ago. Not only was he a major financial help to the family, but he was a great emotional support as well. Since then, we have tried our best to cope with the losses, both emotionally and financially. My sister and I work retail jobs and are the main sources of income, but even our pooled finances do NOT cover bills, rent, and food. (My mother is disabled and cannot work.) Even with SSI, most of the money goes towards rent and bills. Often, we have to go without food for several days at a time or ask to borrow, lots of times without success. I know that you get a lot of sob stories on these types of platforms, but for whomever is reading, I ask that you go over my case and help my family and I as best as you can. It has not been easy, but we are doing our part.
  - Originally I couch surfed and at one point lived in my car. I am a high school student working full time just to get by. I make about $900 a month, but $500 goes to rent, $120 goes to phone bills and the other is gas and groceries. Most the time I under pay the rent by up to $200. I was lucky enough to be taken in by my girlfriend and her parents but they expect me to still contribute to household.

  quotes:
  - I won't receive income until I am approved for disability insurance so I have an account balance of zero dollars. My significant other (whom I live with and share the bills) suffered from a compound fracture in her ankle two days ago. She had to have surgery to reinforce her bones with metal plates and screws. She will be discharged today. The doctor is not allowing her to work for four to six weeks and she only has $600 in her bank account.
  - I am currently a graduate student and will soon be moving to San Diego. Since I am moving I was forced to quit my job. Unfortunately, my mother lost her job a few years back and is unable to support me financially. My father, who now lives in Texas, is also unable to support me. The financial aid I have received from school only covers money for tuition, books, rent, and utilities. I currently don't have the income to purchase food, toiletries, and other necessary items. Receiving an EBT card would lift a large weight off my shoulders, I could focus more on my education rather than how I'm going to make ends meet each month.
  - I am on workers comp. The last 2 months have been hard food wise. My husband's mom sends cash from Russia to help with our rent and my brothers are loaning me money to cover my bills until I get my settlement and can pay them back but it leaves us with only about $150 for food every month for 2 people.
  - We relocated to be closer to family because of our health problems, but we have been unable to secure any permanent housing yet. We’re going broke paying for nightly budget motels which double their rates every weekend. We will most likely be living in our car starting tomorrow until my wife's next social security check comes in next week. We’ll go back to a motel until we can secure housing. I am disabled with COPD and require medical oxygen and a sleep apnea machine, my wife has renal failure and is confined to a wheelchair.
  - My school referred me to CalFresh. I am a senior in college and live on my own. As rewarding as that feels, at the end of the day, I do struggle a lot with paying bills and still having money left over to buy food. No one else supports me, so with the little money I have left over I am normally only able to afford unhealthy meals. If I were to have the opportunity to receive some type of financial assistance, I feel that I would be able to be a heathier person and feel better throughout the day while studying.
  - I spend about $200 on groceries and another $200 on car insurance. My commute to work is 40 miles every day, and it takes about $50 to fill my tank every week ($100 every pay period). I work & I work hard, but I can't do this on my own. I'm tired of just surviving, I'm ready to start thriving. I'm making progress to where I want to be in life, but right now I need some help. Sometimes my roommates eat my food while I'm away at work, so what was supposed to last me a couple of days only lasted a night. I can't afford to keep buying groceries, so I'm just about living off of multi-vitamins & protein shakes. Even if you can't help me, thank you for taking the time to look at my case, & I hope you're having a great day when you read this.
  - As my children are getting older, they are consuming more. Their father, who lives in Colorado, will not increase his monthly child support payments to help cover costs as our children get older. I am a self-employed single mother and in addition have now taken on the caregiver role for my elderly folks, one with dementia and the other who recently had a brain injury. I am not able to make ends meet. Receiving CalFresh benefits would greatly help my situation.

  quotes:
  - Currently, I am looking for a job near my apartment but even with that money I would earn, I still have to pay rent, utilities, and still go to college next month.
  - I have extensive health problems. Due to serious food sensitivities, my diet is very expensive. If I eat food that's come in contact with wheat, corn, or tapioca I will vomit for days. This rules most cheap meal options out. Additionally, I have PTSD and ADHD, which require expensive ongoing medication. My ongoing costs include $150 or so for therapy, which I cannot go without, about $600 for health insurance, paying down a $900 credit card bill, and soon I may need to replace the computer that is my livelihood as far as job hunting goes. I want to save as much as I can so I can move into a rented room when I find a job. I have no family to fall back on. I legally emancipated from my mother at 16 due to abuse, and my father is dead.
  - I have not been able to work for the past three months. Due to medical reasons, I cannot stand for long periods of time. I am self-employed so if I don't work I don't make an income. I'm hoping to have a medical procedure so I can return to work in the next couple of months. My partner has been actively looking for work but he has been my primary caregiver, which has limited his schedule over the past couple of months.
  - I attend a computer science program that offers a tuition Income Share Agreement (ISA). That means I'll give them nearly 30% of my pay once I'm employed, and living assistance ISA to pay for tuition and living costs, so I applied for both this year. Finding part-time work would be difficult - classes are from 9:30AM to 5:20PM on weekdays and our weekends are for working on projects and building our portfolios.
  - I am a full-time PhD student at UCSF. The past few months, after a string of unexpected expenses have caused my credit debt to build, I have found it hard to make ends meet and I haven't been able to save any money to pay my taxes. This has left me very vulnerable and has caused a great deal of stress. Beyond this, I am not allowed to seek outside employment while I am enrolled at UCSF, and I am expected to spend 40-60 hours a week conducting research in a lab.
  - I’m just a student trying to survive in San Francisco. I want to have one less stress which includes food. I don't want to feel depressed that sometimes I barely have anything to eat or can't afford food on campus.
  - I send my mother $175 every month. She uses it for food, bills, and other basic necessities for herself and my younger sister. This takes away the money that I could use for my own groceries.
  - Not working, currently looking for a job, not in school, zero savings left, zero income, credit cards maxed out, can't pay rent, bills, or student loans.
  - I lost my job few months ago and I did some side gigs through a phone app but the app shut down. I'm hungry. I only have 2 dollars left and I've already borrowed from everyone I could ask.
  - I have no money for food. I'm a student in a program that will help me get a job in the tech industry. I have not eaten since Friday.
  - I newly transferred to SFSU, and I would like to be able to cook for myself, since attaining food isn't as simple. I am also in the process of looking for a part-time job.
  - I am a low-income student and the most expensive thing besides transportation is affording food so I hope I will be relieved of these financial barriers. I have skipped meals waiting for my financial aid to arrive as well as trying to budget my food expenses.
  - I'm a recent graduate and I'm currently unemployed, but actively applying for jobs. Once I secure employment, I will pay a small amount for rent to my parents as well as make sure I pay my fines ($2200) to the County Court. Obtaining food stamps will greatly alleviate my financial burden.
  - I'm in a challenging situation right now so I was hoping to get assistance for a few months until I get a job.

  quotes:
  - I suffer from a movement disorder akin to Parkinson's, and it's thought to be myoclonus, or myoclonus dystonia. I can't work as of now, and I am going through further tests to get a precise diagnosis, but it's a lengthy process thus far. I am paying rent with my state disability, as social security has rejected my application for disability. This leaves me with about $20 for the month. This means gas for school and food for myself. I cannot make $20 stretch that far, as much as I would like to. I'm currently appealing the denial, but this process takes time, and I don't have resources to survive, much less the physical capability a lot of the time.
  - I've recently acquired a job but I can't get more hours and I'm barely making enough to cover insurance and housing, and forget even trying to go to college. I have $35 to my name for gas and food for a week.
  - I am 64 years old. I receive SSI SSA. I am also on section 8 housing. I am having a great deal of problems making ends meet.
  - We are currently insured with assistance from Covered California through our old worker. We have a very tight budget and often cannot afford to eat after paying bills. Please assist us asap.
  - I am a full-time, first-generation college student who just moved to San Luis Obispo to pursue an education at Cal Poly SLO. I have just enough money to pay for my rent this month with the money I have in my savings account. Even though I get some government aid to pay for my classes that doesn't include my books and other resources I need for school. I just found a job here and all the money I earn will go towards paying my rent.

  quotes:
  - My husband, newborn baby, and I live with my husband's parents. We do not receive help such as extra money or taken to get groceries and we do pay his parents for rent and utilities. My husband pays for his own car, insurance, and our phone bills, so it doesn't leave us with very much extra money for groceries when only one person is able to work.
  - I receive monthly cancer treatment at Lucile Packard. I hope I qualify because when I get my treatment I need to buy food for myself to keep my weight up.
  - I am changing jobs and looking for an apartment in Roseville. I don't think I'll have enough money to eat soon.
  - I had an injury, lost my job, and then lost my car. I am living on the streets and my bank account is closed. I am trying to stay at a friend's, but sometimes I have nowhere to go. I tried to get into a shelter but I have not gotten in yet. I go to the public library to search for jobs.
  - I am 18 years old. I got kicked out of my father’s household at 16 after many years of abuse throughout my life. My boyfriend and I work full time but struggle to make ends meet at times due to bills and overall the cost of living. We live downstairs in a friend's house. If I could receive help with monthly groceries that would be a huge help. Maybe we can soon move into our own apartment and start saving up money.

  quotes:
  - I am an incoming sophomore student going into UCSB from Florida. My family's household earnings are dominated by my mother, who lives barely above the poverty line. We live in this house which is owned (mortgaged from bank) by my brother, who is in the military and has helped my mom pay for the expenses of me, herself, as well as our 70 year-old grandmother. Going into UCSB as an out of state student places a heavy burden of taking out around sixty-thousand dollars worth of loans in the first year (due to non-residency, and in-dorm housing rent). I support myself as an independent paying for a personal car insurance, as well as healthcare - in order to become a resident of California.
  - My mom passed away about three years ago and I have $8,000 saved up from her insurance that she gave to me which is how I have been able to manage school and living expenses. All that money will be gone in a couple of months with the rent here being so high. My dad just recently got a new job about two weeks ago after being unemployed for a very long time - I was responsible for helping him out until he got back up on his feet.
  - I'm a transfer student at the UC Santa Barbara. My family is unable to help pay for my college. I have been saving up money for three years in order to pay for most of the college expenses. Because of the time my dad spent in the hospital combined with the expenses of buying medication, I'm in a precarious position in affording the necessities of student life, like food every week. My Dad is dealing with depression along with a plethora of other health issues, which have affected his work. My Mom has also been having health issues of her own as she requires a cane due to her bad hip. I am part of the Educational Opportunity Program, which pointed me to CalFresh.
  - I am a first generation college student attending an expensive university in an expensive city. I am looking for additional work to pay for my own food although haven’t had much luck yet. I truly hope I can qualify no matter how small because anything and everything helps.
  - I am part of the EOPS program at Santa Barbara City College and am currently using my credit line for food and gas because I only have enough money to pay rent at the end of the month. I am looking for a job, but only moved here about one month ago.
  - I'm currently a first generation college student and my parents have a low income. I'm trying to get any help possible so that I can stay in school.
  - I am a full time student and work part time to pay my bills. I am taking on loans to pay for my food/utilities/book expenses.
  - I receive substantial financial aid, but finance all other expenses in my life. I work for no pay right now at a philanthropy which takes up most of my time so it's hard for me to work during the school year. During summer, I work 5-6 days a week at a restaurant.
  - I desperately need to eat healthier and be able to afford proper meals while I wait for a hearing with a disability judge. My boyfriend is sick with stress trying to help me for so long. I need security to know I can buy myself food.
  - I am away from my family and it is hard to buy & get healthy food while I am on a budget and I have to be paying a lot for my room and college materials.
  - I've been broke the last couple of months, I was getting maternity leave. I'm going back to work next month, but only part-time. I found a daycare that's perfect for my hours but it’s too expensive - a month of child care is more than my rent. With a new baby that is growing fast, I have to keep up with new clothes plus diapers. Since I'm breast feeding, I'm constantly hungry. I do have WIC.

  quotes:
  - I recently broke my hand and I'm going from job to job. I'm living on the streets in Gilroy, San Martin, & Morgan Hill. I don't do drugs or drink alcohol. At age 13 I was diagnosed with pseudo-hypoparathyroidism type 1b. At a young age I left the house and started living on my own, working, and feeding myself. Now I'm down and need a little help. My stomach is growling as I write this.
  - My unemployment ends June 30th. I have not yet found steady work. I am trying my hardest to find work and keep food on the table for my child. I am desperate to feed my family and I really need help.
  - I was not working as much for a while due to low demand in daycare hours. It has drained my accounts to the point where I have absolutely no money. Thankfully now I have been really busy with work and school, that I can re-apply and actually qualify. I really need the support right now in order to keep going to school and having a place to live and food to eat. This will help me get back up on my feet.
  - I live with my mother and I handle all her financials due to her health conditions. I don't receive any type of child support for my children.
  - I am a full-time student, I work 30 or more hours a week, and I'm pregnant. Any help I can receive is appreciated. Thank you!
  - I became unemployed in the last week. I do not have my rent of $1,000 that is due on the 1st. I lost my job because my babysitter quit on me unexpectedly. I am actively seeking a new job.
  - I used to have CalFresh, but started working and got off it. A couple weeks ago, I lost my job due to my pain in my leg. I'm looking for another job. I applied for SSI three years ago and was only granted partial benefits, but my pain has since gotten worse and it's hard keeping a job.
  - Looking for work, but not having success. I was surviving off savings, but my resources are now exhausted. I am turning to any public assistance I can get just to bridge the gap.
  - I'm 62, my health isn't very good, and I go to dialysis three times a week. I'm trying to get a transplant at Stanford. I really could use a helping hand.
  - I haven’t really eaten in 3 days and I hope I can get this today or soon. I understand there are many people worse off than me... just mentally and physically I could really use this...

  quotes:
  - I have never lived on my own before. Much of it can be overwhelming. Living paycheck-to-paycheck is like a scheduled anxiety attack. My health and weight have declined greatly since moving out because the only food I can afford for myself is fast food and Dollar Tree items. I get sick more often due to my poor health. My goal is to be able to purchase more groceries that are healthier and more nourishing.
  - I finally have stable housing and am going back to school. It would be extremely beneficial for me to have CalFresh as an option while I'm a student so I don't have to worry so hard about where my food income is coming from.
  - I don't get enough nutritious food to eat. I retired at age 65 because my physical job of retail grocery cashier was taking a toll on my body and mental health. I am waiting until age 66 (my full retirement age for social security) because I will need the bit of extra money that I'll receive by waiting. I have never asked for help before and neither has anyone in my immediate family, and I have a bit of shame about applying for this food assistance, but I've been urged by a medical provider to not be so proud and to apply for some short term assistance.
  - I have just recently moved to Santa Cruz. I am a fourth year student and I have come here because in two weeks I have training for an on-campus job. But for now I have no source of income for groceries. I also am not receiving any financial support from my mother because she has to support my three brothers back home. And my father has recently gotten released from jail and we've had very little contact in the past seven months. This is the first time that I will live off campus and not have a meal plan.
  - I hate asking for help, but I'm down to my last straw here.
  - I just got hired at a new job. I will start working Friday, September 28th. I am expecting to work 20-25 hours a week but I do not have any paystubs to show now.
  - I'm a low-income student and my family cannot pay for my tuition, send money for food, supplies, etc.
  - I have two work study internships on campus and will be living in a college apartment without a meal plan. The expense of groceries would be one less thing I would have to worry about with CalFresh.
  - This year I decided to live off campus since it was really expensive on campus. My financial aid covers for my housing but there is not enough left over for me to buy groceries. I was hoping CalFresh could help me pay for my groceries and not stress about taking more hours at work to have enough money for everything.
  - My girlfriend and I are both college students and work to pay the bills. Neither of us gets help from family.
  - I just paid rent and apart from saving for next month's rent, I don't have other money. I need help buying food.
  - I'm a full time student. Before becoming a student, I had been supporting myself entirely since I was 19. I struggle with food security and am not hoping to use this resource forever, just enough to eat 3 meals a day while trying to get an education.

  quotes:
  - After taking six weeks of paid family leave to care for my ailing husband, my employer said there was no work for me. I applied for unemployment benefits, which I received and am currently on. Once my husband passed away, we stopped receiving his disability benefits and can't pay for rent and utilities.
  - I have a worker’s compensation claim. I have now been switched to Permanent Disability and that amount is only $580 every 2 weeks. This has left me in a really bad place. At this time, I am waiting for a hearing on my case. I am in limbo but in the meantime my family is suffering due to this hardship. I am a hard working person who has been off work since May 2017! I am in depression!
  - My son had a heart attack and open heart surgery. He cannot work and needs home care for a few months. I am financially unable to take care of both of us. He moved in with me about 8 months ago and did odd jobs for money. I was doing occasional caregiver jobs for extra income but now neither one of us can work and the rent increased when he moves in with me.
  - It's hard to find work while caring for an elderly family member as I am the only person around to help with lifting and things of that nature.
  - My husband started nursing school in August and can only manage 24 hours a week at work now. His main at-home care client was in the hospital this month and so we won't be getting a paycheck this week.
  - I recently lost my job. I applied for unemployment insurance and started the process of establishing my own business while taking interviews and submitting resumes. I'm applying for assistance for myself and my two sons while I'm having this tough time!
  - My spouse is completely unable to work. I can barely afford to keep the roof over our heads and there is no money left for food.

  quotes:
  - I lost my home in the Tubbs Fire. All of my money that I did receive from FEMA went to hotel costs. After couch surfing for six months, I finally found a friend who had a room opening up. Unfortunately, I had spent everything on hotel costs, rental applications, and simply trying to get my life back together. I have nothing left. I need help. I'm putting myself in debt because I thought now would be a good time to see a dentist after seven years... I figure no one is going to actually read this anyway, so it's mostly just venting. Maybe I'll get lucky, and whoever's in charge of my case will at least understanding what those of us who didn't own three homes before the Tubbs Fire are struggling with.
  - My husband is a carpenter and his job is not steady. Last month was a good month and he grossed about $3.000.00, but not every month is not like that. Our bills are so behind. The fires really did us in - my husband was out of work for over 30 days. My oldest son has been diagnosed with autism, and has some heart problems. My boys are growing and feeding them has taken a huge toll on our finances.
  - I've lived at this address since mid 2010. The rent has increased exponentially since new ownership of the apartment complex began earlier this year. I'm destitute and cannot afford both food and medication. I am an IHSS recipient and have been bedridden since January of 2018.
  - I have to sell things to make my mortgage payment and to eat. I am also applying for disability.
  - I need help to buy food for my 10 year-old sister. I had to become her Legal Guardian.
  - I lost my job in early September. It looks like I am going to be turned down for unemployment so I am getting desperate.
  - I have been on Workman’s Comp for 10 months with no end in sight. I am eating with a very low budget and not very healthy. I'm struggling, I'm not even sure if I qualify but I have to try.
  - My husband got sick with endocarditis last Nov and had to have open heart surgery to fix his mitral valve last month. He suffered a stroke 3 weeks ago and we have been hurting financially because of all the health setbacks.

  quotes:
  - My mother has been diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis which has left her paralyzed from 80% of her body, leaving her unable to work. My father is 69 years old and permanently disabled due to osteoporosis. I am currently a full-time student at the Cal State here and also work a part-time job. There is not enough income in my home for us to get the proper nutrition we all need. My father already receives food stamps but because I am anemic, I require a special diet and often times find myself needing to buy my food separately. My mother is also diabetic, so she too requires a special diet.
  - I live with my family and sometimes we don't have enough to feed us all. So I sometimes skip lunch or don't eat anything that day in order to save some money to buy things I need for my education.
  - I stay with my boyfriend and our situation in the place we stay is temporary. I am pregnant about 6 months. I set an appointment up so I can provide proof. I don’t have a steady income. I help some people I know do basic things that may be difficult for them and they offer money sometimes to help me out. I don’t receive a set amount yet it all goes towards living expenses.
  - My husband recently lost his full time job. His other job is only per diem and averages $50-100 a month. We took money out of our savings to pay for at least 4 months’ rent. We only have $100 in our savings now and that's being used for gas. I am currently 5 months pregnant. My husband and I really need help with groceries, even if it's just until my husband gets a new job.

  quotes:
  - I do not qualify for social security until I turn 66 in 2020. I just filed for unemployment and am currently searching for work, as I have a mortgage and bills to pay. I am drawing on my retirement savings to pay living expenses. The unemployment monthly payment is to be about $380, and I have not yet received payment. Jobs I am interviewing for are offering as low as $13 per hour. I have reluctantly applied for this food aid program due to the high cost of living in California.
  - I was in a car accident and am currently not working. I do not expect to have any income until October. I have custody of my 4 year-old granddaughter and her benefits are used to pay for her school.
  - I work inconsistent hours. This week I worked 30 hours, but next week I'll only work 14. I hate having to dig into my retirement savings to pay for rent.
  - Both I and my son are disabled. We receive SSI disability benefits. My other kid are in college. He is doing internship on campus and he has a job at a smoothie place to help pay his college expenses. I am usually with my disabled son 24 hours a day as he suffers from epilepsy and can have an attack at any time. My husband lost his job and is now on a job where he is paid 1099 and its sale based. The commission he receives of $2000 is temporary. He will have to go straight commission in 3 months regardless of what he has sold.
  - My wife and I pay a lot for health insurance because we both have autoimmune diseases. We have been putting most extra money toward doctor care and don't have much left for food now.
  - We just moved down from Washington and I haven’t been able to get a job as of yet. With rent having to be paid we don't much left for other necessities. Something to get my family through this time would be deeply appreciated.

  - Until four weeks ago I had been working as an ambulance EMT, but I was laid off. They call it a termination to avoid paying unemployment benefits, but our entire division was "fired" which consists of about six medics who were good at their jobs. We all got taken advantage of. I just need a little help while I look for another EMT job.
  - As a college student without much money, trying to buy enough healthy food at the grocery store is a real challenge. I'd like to make healthier food choices and focus more on my academics and less on what I'll be able to eat everyday.
  - I am applying for CalFresh because I am struggling to pay for food. I am currently going to college as a full time student, and I do not have full financial aid coverage. I rely on some money from my parents, but it is usually barely enough to pay for my tuition and rent. My parents’ income is less than middle class, and on top of that, they live in San Francisco, and almost everything there is quite expensive, so they are also struggling to pay for their own necessities after rent. My mom was forced to quit her job just early this year because her lease for her store got terminated. I feel very bad having to ask them for money for food. I also had some personal and family struggles resulting in this, but I am determined to finish college within four years.
  - I am a full time student at UC Davis and babysit 15-20 hours a week depending on my schoolwork. Having food stamps throughout the next year would allow to me to focus on school and my future.
  - My parents can only offer limited support as they have 6 other children. For the most part I am solely responsible for ensuring my education, and right now I'm trying to budget things and food is definitely a concern.
  - Unfortunately, my parents had to move to another country because they couldn't afford to live here. I have no relatives or family around. I am attending UC Davis and I was supposed to receive financial aid but they haven't completed my package. It's been really hard to pay for everything by myself since I'm a student and can't work full time.
  - I am a student and am looking for a job. My parents are struggling to pay for my tuition as well as my rent because they have a whole list of their own debts that they're still trying to pay off. I would like to contribute as much as possible to my rent and tuition. CalFresh would help me eat quality food without worrying about breaking the bank. Anything helps.
  - Recently separated from husband. My children and I are living with my parents, who helped us get a rental property so that I could get the kids into a public school. I'm trying to meet the requirements to get my license in CA for my profession and am almost done, so I can start looking for work. I move into my new place in/around the 10th-15th of Oct., where the rent will be $1995/mo. My parents are helping as much as they can and I receive unemployment until I find work, but I'm not bringing in much.
  - I said that I have a disability and I wanted to elaborate. I have a brain tumor that has left half of my throat and mouth paralyzed. Because of this, I must keep my immune system in top shape and I consider healthy food to be medicine. I am applying for food stamps because healthy foods are expensive and I can't afford them on my own.
  - I am a single mother and recently became unemployed due to my job being too far away... I stay with my parents but do pay rent... my daughter's father is not involved as much as he should be I am not sure where he is staying or whether or not he is employed...
