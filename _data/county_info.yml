  quotes:
  - I am doing a "year of service" for Habitat for Humanity and Americorps. I will
    be building multi-family homes and tiny homes for lower-income families and the
    homeless. Because this is a service position I will only be provided with a very
    small living stipend (~$900 a month). I am a recent college graduate who just
    finished paying off their student loans and because of that, I don't have much
    money saved.
  - 'I was married when I came out of the closet. I couldnt get out of the marriage
    even though my wife long knew that I was gay so I went to my mom''s. My mom couldn''t
    accept me being gay, nor could my siblings. I left for the Bay Area. I originally
    planned to pay the bills driving for Uber, but my car was stolen. I have a new
    job, but need to wait two weeks before getting paid so I can buy basic things
    like food. '
  - 'I''m currently enrolled at UC Berkeley and my finances are very tight. I receive
    some money in grants and scholarships but I take out $5,000 in loans every year
    and I have to work part-time 10-15 hours/week. I''ve been doing this since my
    first year in college and I am now entering my final year. I come from a single
    parent, low-income household so I cannot ask my dad for financial help. My dad
    only makes $25-30K a year and he pays for health insurance, the mortgage on a
    house, utilities, and car expenses so I never wish to put a larger burden on him.
    I received EBT last year and it was extremely helpful. I was able to buy healthy
    groceries. '
  - I just moved to CA for school, I am getting my teaching credential. I made and
    saved money over the summer, but it will be difficult for me to work as I have
    to do 15-20 hours of unpaid student teaching a week in addition to my classes.
    While my rent and utilities are part of my school expenses that are being mostly
    covered by student loans, I still have to make loan payments, pay for insurance,
    gas, groceries, etc. in addition to the fees for tests to get my credential. I
    have no family support in CA.
  - 'I''m struggling really bad, to the point of being in debt. I know that other
    bills don''t count in this process but I have lived here on my own for almost
    4 years paying 1800 for just bills alone every month, trying to pay off debt,
    school, etc. I never have enough to eat. Ramen noodles, eggs, cereal everyday
    just to save up money for bills. I''ve been going to the hospital to see what
    is wrong with me, but I believe I just need to eat properly. I''m almost 22 now,
    and I have another year of school. I honestly don''t know how I will make it if
    I have no family here. '
  - I am currently applying for grad school, which is extremely expensive. We are
    still living in Berkeley even though we both graduated. The rent is extremely
    high here and we receive absolutely no financial assistance from our parents.
    Since we graduated from UC Berkeley this past summer, we are also no longer receiving
    financial aid, which has significantly impacted our ability to support ourselves.
    We both now work in San Francisco and transportation to and from the city every
    day is quite costly. We are struggling to find the extra funds to feed ourselves
    after paying for rent, utilities, public transit, loans, grad school applications,
    and everything in between.
  - 'I work twice a week, which is the most that I can work with my school schedule.
    Last semester was very hard. I would either have class all day, or have class
    and get off and work, or on weekends I would work. I did not have a single day
    off for 4 months straight to skim by. I would have to choose between eating or
    school supplies. This is affecting my mental and physical health. I hope that
    I can make this year better, and be excited for school, not dread it... '
  - I'm in medical school and am taking out ~$33,000 in loans every four months. I'm
    spending more than half of my loan money on rent and utilities. Since I'm in medical
    school, I have to do volunteer work to gain more knowledge and skills in order
    to be the best doctor I can become. I have no time outside of this to work for
    money, or else I'd be jeopordizing my education. Because of the high cost of living
    in the Bay Area, I'm struggling to pay for groceries, basic living expenses, and
    car insurance so that I can get to and from the clinic I'm volunteering in at
    Martinez. I do not buy as much food as I need because of the expenses of living
    and the books/technology/transportation costs required for me to learn medicine.
  - I do not receive any financial support from my father, and my mother works tirelessly
    in two jobs to feed my younger brother and to help me with college. I help my
    mom pay the water, light and gas bills for our apartment back in southern California,
    and I also pay the water, gas, and light bills for my apartment here in Berkeley.
    Our financial situation is not the best, and a CalFresh card would be a huge blessing
    and support.

  quotes:
  - I have been unemplyed this last month. I am in the process of getting hired at
    an on campus job in university housing, though I have multiple applications out
    for more job opportunities. Although some of my schooling is covered through CalVet
    college fee waiver program, I am struggling to cover extra school fees and books.
    I am trying to further my future by earning a degree to one day be finacially
    stable and available to help others in need.
  - 'This is my 2nd year at CSU Chico and during my first year I had no problems with
    money as my financial aid covered most of it, the rest was barely paid for by
    my parents. I found out last year after multiple visits to the financial aid office
    that for the rest of my education that I will not be getting almost any financial
    aid. It was for the reason that my parents just barely made the line of which
    to receive financial aid and so I ended up getting $750 (in grants) this year
    instead of the $12,000 (in grants) from last year. My dad works as a construction
    worker and it''s only on certain weeks that he gets paid good which ends up making
    it like we have money but in reality, the pay is inconsistent. Anyways seeing
    this my parents and friends have told me to drop out but I really did not want
    to give up on college. I am looking for a job to help cover my expenses. '

  quotes:
  - I just moved out of my single-mother's house. I still help her with bills and
    also try to pay my own rent and utilities with the little money I could provide.
    I can only afford to work part-time because I am also in school and in the ROTC
    program. I would be very grateful to have some help with being able to buy nutritious
    food instead of settling for quick, unhealthy food such as ramen and hot dogs.
  - I have various medical conditions, endometriosis, bipolar disorder, etc., which
    caused my copays for my medications to skyrocket. My medications are number one
    for me to stay on. But that has made it hard to keep food that is supposed to
    be on my diet in the kitchen. When you are trying to make $30 last a week for
    groceries, it's hard to buy vegetables and fruit. I have gone down two sizes in
    a month trying to balance out food and my medications and prescribed PRNS. Being
    allowed the assistance for food would lessen the stress around the costs of medications
    and mental health services.
  - 'I need help with many basic day to today activities of daily living, because
    im disabled and have great difficulty getting things done. I''m currently suffering
    of rheumatiod arthritis, fibromyalgia, and seizures. I''m also suffering of a
    severly injured back and possible some other disease that is causing me great
    abnormal weightloss and extreme fatigue. I''m currently working with my PCP, to
    figure out what is causing it. '

  - 'I started a long term subtitute teacher position, but do not get paid until September
    10th. I anticipate this amount to be $1500 for the amount of time I worked in
    August. The hours for my sub job are irregular. I was not able to work June &
    July because school was closed. I am looking for a fulltime teaching job. '
  - 'I was a full time student last semester, will be a part time student this upcoming
    (summer semester) and if I still don''t have a job in the fall will resume being
    a full time student. I am currently in the application process for summer internships.
    I''m staying in my ex-husbands house for a while, I am in the same house as my
    kids, but I don''t have the funds to pitch in (and they are over 18). My daughter
    pays for my cell phone. The only bill I have is for my stuff in storage. I am
    saving up money for my car which needs 980.00 in engine work and new brakes. '
  - I'd like to be able to make healthier food choices which would improve my health
    and overall help me focus more on my academics and less on what I'll be eating
    everyday.
  - 'My boyfriend and I have been homeless for months. In Janurary we were in a car
    accident that totalled $48,000. Following that I got extreamly sick and wasnt
    able to work so i was forced to quit. I was kicked out of my house at 17 in Febuary
    and moved into my boyfriend''s house after spending a week in a shelter. He has
    a fulltime job which barely makes ends meet. We often go to bed so hungry it''s
    hard to sleep. '

  quotes:
  - 'I was an registered nurse until I fractured my right heel bone and was forced
    to retire - disability was declined. The only income I have is Social Security
    ($1,047/month). Each month, my expenses average $75 for major medical insurance,
    $80 for one prescription medication, $54 for auto insurance, $30 for auto registration,
    $250 for propane for cooking and heating (I live in a camper). I do not have dental
    insurance and can''t afford to get care for my bad teeth. I really need help for
    food and other basic necessities. '
  - 'I became ill in Dec 2017 and am currently on unpaid company leave. I now only
    have Social Security retirement benefits. I live with my boyfriend and his mother.
    They are both disabled and his home care worker shops and provides their food
    from their disability and retirement income. I purchase my own food due to a special
    diet. I am having surgery next week and will be home several weeks to recover. '
  - 'I''m 25 and I take care of my grandma who has been on dialysis for the past 11
    years. I offer my daily help for free and I have done this for several years however,
    it has become increasingly hard to support myself with very little money and hardly
    any family support. I go to local churches and food drives and get food for my
    grandpa, grandma and myself. Unfortunately, I find that many days and nights I
    go hungry. I am extremely independent - seeking help for others is easy, but for
    myself I have trouble accepting anything I don''t feel I earned, but everyone
    needs a little help to get on their feet sometimes. I don''t intend to take advantage
    of CalFresh services for a over extended period. Only until I find a job that
    can allow me flexible hours while my grandma needs my continued support. '

    I had to enroll in school and get my kids started back to school. I am trying
    to sort out my situation and have some family help but have urgent need for food
    assistance and expect that to be the case for some time as my husband says he's
    not helping any further and I have a few years before I will be able to become
    a nurse, and school prohibits me from working full time. I am not eligible for
    unemployment as I have been home raising kids all these years.

    have it in the budget. Now I''m unemployed and applying for jobs. My partner cannot
    afford to support us on his $400/per 2 week pay checks. '
  - My unemployment ran out in April. I am under a one year lease. My son works where
    I used to work, and he has the only income for the family. The rent is all of
    our income. My other children are in college full time and there is no work-study
    this year. They are on grants for their academics through PELL and SEOG. I really
    want someone who can evaluate our situtation and provide resources. Thank you.
  - 'Even if our income is around $3,000 per month, with credit card bills, auto insurance,
    gas, clothes, diapers, utility bills, repairing the old car, etc... it gets expensive
    and times we cannot keep up with affording food so spending $8 for 4 on McDonalds
    or boiling potatoes with salt is what we have to do to survive. Because of our
    income my kids are no longer able to have MediCal and if we have to pay for overpriced
    health insurance, we might as well be homeless. '
  - I have a car payment that's $336 every month and a weekly daycare bill of $175.
    After rent, the phone bill, and gas, I have nearly nothing to spend on food. I
    often don't eat so that my child can eat. I feel terrible feeding him cheap unhealthy
    food because I enjoy cooking but I can't afford the ingredients to even cook anything.
    It's embarressing, but I often eat leftover food at work or the school cafeteria
    so I have the energy to function. So I would absoulutely appreciate any help I
    can get.
  - Not sure if this helps at all. The last time I had to renew my CalFresh all I
    needed to do was to update and give some paperwork and I kept forgetting, just
    like I forget a lot of things and stress about them. I struggle from paycheck
    to paycheck and at times I do ask my parents for money or food especially because
    my daughter is growing and eating more. We do live in a low income housing and
    we qualify for the HEAP program for our PGE. I do go to the food bank when I can
    which is a big help but we still need help with other foods.

  - 'I am currently in difficult financial bind- never been in a postion such as now.
    Even help for one month would help my son and I immensely. I just started working
    my regular, consistent hours at the school. I was off during the summer and working
    our summer daycare for just about 3 hours a day except field trip days (1-2 times
    per week). I barely got by. I am almost embarrassed to be here, but hey, it happens,
    and I know I am not alone. First and foremost, my son needs to know that food
    will always be available. '
  - 'I used to average 30-35 hrs a week, but the last two months it''s been fewer
    hours... last paycheck I grossed $275 for 22 hrs. I just need help for 6 months
    or less while we are in the slow period until work picks back up. Just worried
    about the coming months. '
  - I lost my job, the restaurant where I worked for the last 13 years was sold. My
    second job is only 1 hour 15 minutes every day serving lunch at a school district
    and we dont get paid during the summer break, my husband's second job is very
    variable sometimes he can work one or two days a week but sometimes he does not
    work at all for a month. In May we had to move because the owner of the condo
    where we were renting had to sell it. Our monthly rent increased by $700. We just
    found out that the electricity here in Fullerton is so much more expensive than
    Anaheim and we are already behind on payments with Edison for $390!! Our 7 year
    old kid used to attend after school program which was free, but in our new place
    we have to pay $70 registration and $305 a month; our kindergardener's new program
    was $55 registration and $385 a month! We can't afford our youngest boy's preschool
    anymore. After deducting the medical, vision, and dental insurance for the 5 of
    us and taxes, there's very little left my husband's paycheck. Not to mention all
    other expenses such as gasoline, food, clothes, etc...
  - I've had 3 back injuries this year. I work as a caregiver to the elderly in their
    homes. I go without pay when I take time off work or decline offered jobs from
    my agency due to my back injuries. I can only afford to eat once or twice a day
    and my health is declining. I buy most of my own food. I try my best not to eat
    the healthy foods that my parents buy or cook because my father is diabetic and
    my mother is prediabetic and they need healthy food for themselves. Also, I have
    about $1000 in a bank account that was gifted to me for school. The only reason
    I'm able go to college this Fall semester is because I got gifted that money.
    I have not touched that money for anything.
  - 'I never thought i would ever apply for this help, but things started to quickly
    go downhill when I got a DUI two years ago. I had a great job working as a tank
    driver delivering fuel to gasoline stations. I paid big time for my bad decision.
    I lost everything. I lost my job and then my girlfriend left with our kids because
    I didn''t have any income. I fell into a big depression... I just need a little
    help for a couple months as I''m already working on getting my class A license
    again. '
  - It still feels strange to have to skip 1-2 meals a day. I don't like to think
    of myself as the type of person that complains about their situation either. I
    will always do anything in my power to overcome adverse situations. By applying
    for CalFresh, I don't see myself as complacent, but attempting to take control
    of my situation and the cards life has dealt me.
  - 'I may be having to move in the next 1 to 4 weeks, depending on the grace of my
    landlord, otherwise I will be homeless. I have no family support at this time
    and no friends willing or able to help me. I have pop tarts and tomato soup and
    frozen burritos until I can get help from Cal Fresh. I have multiple physical
    and mental health challenges and doctor appointments each week. '
  - 'We just recently moved here to California and are struggling each month with
    enough money to properly buy groceries after rent, insurance, gas, utilities,
    conservice and vehicle bills. I am currently pregnant which will make 4 in this
    household by November and I am nervous we won''t be buy enough food. We cannot
    afford childcare so I have to stay home with my children. Hoping we can get any
    kind of help there is available, even a little goes a LONG way. '
  - 'I am a sophmore in college paying for my own rent, tuition, food, books, and
    all other expenses. I receive no financial assisance from either of my parents
    because they are not capable of doing so while also maintaining financially stablility
    themselves. I have to budget my spending on food especially. I have often skipped
    meals in fear that if I spend too much money on food I may not have enough funds
    to pay for rent. '
  - Sheltered, with long time friends. Unable to pay any rent, but help with their
    utilities when able. I pay for my cell phone only. I have not found fulltime work,
    despite a 4 year college business degree and 35 years of experience, since 2008.
    All resources meant for retirement have had to be used, and are depleted. Until
    last summer, I had paid all my bills on time for 35 years. Bankruptcy is scheduled
    next month. The car goes to repo tomorrow. I have HIV and am disabled depending
    on which social service or doctor you talk to, and am unable to get SSI. I am
    unable to get a job interview for full-time anything, all in my 50's. Well, it
    was damn good until 2008. Thank you for letting me vent a little. So glad I didn't
    have a mortgage, or children. I would have been a great dad.
  - I was a caregiver for and lived with my dad who passed in 2016. My sisters want
    to sell the house even though they know my son, nephew, and I have no place to
    go. I am disabled but have not applied for SSI yet until I talk to a surgeon.
    I feel like I messed up the rest of my life so that my parents didn't have to
    go in nursing homes. I am so hungry. My dad said whoever is living in the home
    can stay in it and he preferred the house stays in the family.
  - 'I am the only one who takes care of my groceries, medical bills, CT scan test.
    I had to leave my job of 9 years as I became very ill with lung cancer, despite
    never having smoked. I now only have 1/2 of my right lung. I cannot work as I
    still struggle with this health issue. I have no income, used all my disablity,
    and have exhaused my unemployment insurance. I am still disabled it has only been
    since August end of the month that I was released. I cannot pay my rent, copays
    for oncologist. After 3 hours of light activity I get very exhaused and my body
    aches. I have back lumbar pain and still recovering from two surgeries to remove
    the cancer. I am sure if I had money I could get food and that will boost my energy
    a little. I need help please. Right away I am hungry and need food. '

  quotes:
  - Financially not making it. My landlord is about to begin eviction proceedings
    on me as my rent has been late every month. I struggle to get enough food for
    my home. I feed my kids before I feed myself. I recently ended up in the hospital
    from dehydration and malnourishment.
  - In February, I moved to Sacramento from Bakersfield because my landlord asked
    me to leave (I was behind on rent and couldn't pay). I have been working as an
    appraiser for 16 years, but since moving to Sacramento I haven't been able to
    find work. A couple weeks ago, my annual software fees were due as well as my
    business insurance and I was unable to pay. This has shut down my business. I
    am looking for work. I am selling things in order to survive on a daily basis.
    I anticipate this request for food stamps to be temporary. I look forward to getting
    back on my feet soon but, some assistance, especially food assistance, would help
    immensely.
  - Originally I couch surfed and at one point lived in my car. I am a high school
    student working full time just to get by. I make about $900 a month, but $500
    goes to rent, $120 goes to phone bills and the other is gas and groceries. Most
    the time I under pay the rent by up to $200. I was lucky enough to be taken in
    by my girlfriend and her parents but they expect me to still contribute to household.
  - I pay for wifi also and I take care of my emotional support dog Charlotte who
    is about 35 lbs. So any extra funds I have left goes to feeding and keeping her
    groomed. I can't walk to food pantries and such as they are too far. I get help
    from friends or neighbors with a hot meal here and there. I am starving almost
    after the first week after payday and I am becoming more unhealthy. I do not know
    what else to do. I am hungry now as I am typing this.
  - I go back to college in August. I financially qualify for a government grant,
    however, due to mental health illness I failed many classes. Therefore, I cannot
    receive assistance due to my unsatisfactory academic progress. During the last
    six months I have been couch surfing with family. I worked part time for a month
    to save up enough to move back and pay for tuition. I am currently borrowing money
    from family members just to pay rent and buy food. I am looking for a job that
    gives me at least 23 hours a week. I really don't want to do this, but I need
    help. I just have to get through this to graduate.
  - 'I am helping my adult son apply. He has a disability, he was diagnosed with mild
    retardation by social security physicians when he was about 8. At 18 they said
    he did not qualify anymore, which I disagree with. I''ve been wanting to reapply
    for him but havent had the chance. Since we have moved to Sacramento I haven''t
    been able to work a steady job because of my disease. I can''t afford to support
    my adult son as I also have two younger children I support on my own and it is
    very, very hard. My son is staying here and there with no stable place to live.
    I try my best to take him food to eat when i can. I dont know what else to do. '
  - 'I am legally deaf due to a recent illness. A friend loaned me a hearing aid.
    I can only use phone on speaker. I am terrified of not getting medical treatment
    or having a place to live because of my income and disability status. i have been
    disabled for 30 years. A recent illness caused my condition to worsen. i need
    help. '

  quotes:
  - I am currently a graduate student and will soon be moving to San Diego. Since
    I am moving I was forced to quit my job. Unfortunately, my mother lost her job
    a few years back and is unable to support me financially. My father, who now lives
    in Texas, is also unable to support me. The financial aid I have recieved from
    school only covers money for tuition, books, rent, and utilities. I currently
    don't have the income to purchase food, toiletries, and other necessary items.
    Recieving an EBT card would lift a large weight off my shoulders, I could focus
    more on my education rather than how I'm going to make ends meet each month.
  - 'We relocated to San Diego to be close to family because of our health problems,
    but we have been unable to secure any permanent housing yet and have been going
    broke paying for nightly budget motels which double their rates every weekend.
    We will most likely be living in our car starting tommorow until my wife''s next
    social security check comes in next week and then back to a motel until we can
    secure housing i am disabled with copd and require medical oxygen and a sleep
    apnea machine wife has renal failure and confined to a wheelchair. '
  - 'My school referred me to CalFresh. I am a senior in college and live on my own.
    As rewarding as that feels, at the end of the day, I do struggle a lot with paying
    bills and still having money left over to buy food. No one else supports me, so
    with the little money I have left over I am normally only able to afford unhealthy
    meals. If I were to have the oppurtunity to receive some type of financial assistance,
    I feel that I would be able to be a heathier person and feel beter throughout
    the day while studying. '
  - 'I spend about $200 on groceries and another $200 on car insurance. My commute
    to work is 40 miles every day, and it takes about $50 to fill my tank every week
    ($100 every pay period). I work & I work hard, but I can''t do this on my own.
    I''m tired of just surviving, I''m ready to start thriving. I''m making progress
    to where I want to be in life, but right now I need some help. Sometimes my roommates
    eat my food while I''m away at work, so what was supposed to last me a couple
    of days only lasted a night. I can''t afford to keep buying groceries, so I''m
    just about living off of multi-vitamins & protein shakes. Even if you can''t help
    me, thank you for taking the time to look at my case, & I hope you''re having
    a great day when you read this. '
  - 'As my children are getting older, they are consuming more. Their father, who
    lives in Colorado, will not increase his monthly child support payments to help
    cover costs as our children get older. I am a self-employed single mother and
    in addition have now have taken on the caregiver role for my elderly folks, one
    with dementia and the other who recently had a brain injury. I am not able to
    make ends meet. Receiving CalFresh benefits would greatly help my situation. '
  - I am on workers comp. The last 2 months have been hard food wise. My husbands
    mom sends cash from Russia to help with our rent and my brothers are loaning me
    money to cover my bills until I get my settlement and can pay them back but it
    leaves us with only about $150 for food every month for 2 people. My husband is
    worried about it affecting his immigration status and so thats one of the main
    issues we are worried about.
  - 'This past Friday, my doctor told me I was disabled. I won''t recieve income until
    I am approved for disability insurance so I have an account balance of 0 dollars.
    In addition, my significant other (with whom I live and share the bills) suffered
    from a comound fracture in her ankle two days ago. She had to have surgery to
    reinforce her bones with metal plates and screws. She will be discharged today.
    The doctor is not allowing her to work for four to six weeks and she only has
    600 dollars in her bank account. '

  quotes:
  - Currently, I am looking for a job near my apartment but even with that money I
    would earn, I still have to pay rent, utilities, and still go to college next
    month.
  - I am a full time PhD student at UCSF, and I do receive a modest stipend that would
    be enough to live on if not for insane rent prices in San Francisco and a pile
    of debt. The past few months, after a string of unexpected expenses have caused
    my credit debt to build, I have found it hard to make ends meet and I haven't
    been able to save any money to pay my taxes. This has left me very vulnerable
    and has caused a great deal of stress. Beyond this, I am not allowed to seek outside
    employment while I am enrolled at UCSF, and I am expected to spend 40-60 hours
    a week conducting research in a lab.
  - I currently cannot work and have not been able to work for the past 3 months.
    Due to medical reasons I cannot stand for long periods of time. I am self-employed
    so if I don't work I don't make an income. I'm hoping to have a medical procedure
    in the next couple of months so I can return to work. My partner has been actively
    looking for work in the past couple of months but he has been my primary caregiver,
    which leaves his schedule limited.
  - I have extensive health problems. Due to serious food sensitivities, my diet is
    very expensive. If I eat food that's come in contact with wheat, corn, or tapioca
    I will vomit for days. This rules most cheap meal options out. Additionally, I
    have PTSD and ADHD, which require expensive ongoing medication. My ongoing costs
    include $150 or so for therapy, which I can not go without, about $600 for health
    insurance, paying down a $900 credit card bill, and soon I may need to replace
    the computer that is my livelihood as far as job hunting goes. I want to save
    as much as I can so I can move into a rented room when I find a job. I have no
    family to fall back on. I legally emancipated from my mother at 16 due to abuse,
    and my father is dead.

  quotes:
  - I suffer from a movement disorder akin to Parkinson's, and it's thought
    to be myoclonus, or myoclonus dystonia. I can't work as of now, and I am going
    through further tests to get a precise diagnosis, but it's a lengthy process
    thus far. I am paying rent with my state disability, as social security has rejected
    my application for disability. This leaves me with about $20 for the month. This
    means gas for school and food for myself. I cannot make $20 stretch that far,
    as much as I would like to. I'm currently appealing the denial, but this process
    takes time, and I don't have resources to survive, much less the physical capability
    a lot of the time.

  - 'I am an incoming sophomore student going into UCSB from Florida. My family''s
    household earnings are dominated by my mother, who lives barely above the poverty
    line. We live in this house which is owned (mortgaged from bank) by my brother,
    who is in the military and has helped my mom pay for the expenses of me, herself,
    as well as our 70 year old grandmother. Going into UCSB as an out of state student
    places a heavy burden of taking out around sixty-thousand dollars worth of loans
    in the first year (due to non-residency, and in-dorm housing rent). I support
    myself as an independent paying for a personal car insurance, as well as healthcare
    - in order to become a resident of California. '

  quotes:
  - 'I have never lived on my own before - much of it can be overwhelming, especially
    when everything that I used to have help with I now face alone. I realized how
    quickly things add up and its more and more stressful to keep up. I''d like to
    think I can make it without assistance but the reality is I''m not in a place
    where I can do that yet. Living paycheck to paycheck is like a scheduled anxiety
    attack. My health and weight have declined greatly since moving out because the
    only food I can afford for myself is fast food & dollar tree items. I get sick
    more often due to my poor health. My goal is to be able to purchase more groceries
    that are healthier & more nourishing. '
  - 'I finally have stable housing and going back to school. It would be extremely
    beneficial for me to have CalFresh as an option while I''m a student so I don''t
    have to worry so hard about where my food income is coming from. '
  - 'I have just recently moved to Santa Cruz. I am a fourth year student and I have
    come here because in two weeks I have training for an on-campus job. But for now
    I have no source of income for groceries. I also am not recieving any finanicial
    support from my mother because she has to support my three brothers back home.
    And my father has recently gotten released from jail and we''ve had very little
    contact in the past seven months. This is the first time that I will live off
    campus and not have a meal plan. '
  - I have an adult daughter in Portland, OR with type one diabetes and a rare renal
    tube disorder called Gitlemans syndrom. She cant work much but is proud and works
    as much as she can. I help her a great deal financially. I don't get enough nutritcious
    food to eat. I retired at age 65 because my physical job of retail grocery casheir
    was taking a toll on my body and mental health. I am waiting until age 66 (my
    full retirement age for social security) because I will need the bit of extra
    money that I'll receive by waiting. I have never asked for help before and neither
    has anyone in my immediate family and I have a bit of shame about applying for
    this food assistance, but I've been urged by a medical provider to not be so proud
    and to apply for some short term assistance.

  quotes:
  - My husband is a carpenter and his job is not steady. Last month was a good month
    and he grossed about $3.000.00, but not every month is not like that. Our bills
    are so behind. The fires really did us in - my husband was out of work for over
    30 days. My oldest son has been diagnosed with autisim, and has some heart problems.
    My boys are growing and feeding them has taken a huge toll on our finances.
  - I lost my home in the Tubbs Fire, and because of complications with FEMA not being
    able to understand that I was renting a room out of a large home with multiple
    people sharing the same situation as I, I did not receive lodging assistance.
    All of my money that I did receive from FEMA ended up going to hotel costs. After
    couch surfing for 6 months, I finally found a friend who had a room opening up.
    Unfortunatly I had spent everything on hotel costs, rental aplications, and simply
    trying to get my life back together. I have nothing left. Not even enough to spare
    for yet another rental application that will most likely be denied. I need help.
    I can't even afford to buy myself a new bed. I'm putting myself in debt because
    I thought now would be a good time to see a dentist after 7 years... I figure
    no one is going to actually read this anyway, so it's mostly just venting. Maybe
    I'll get lucky, and who ever's in charge of this case will at least get an understanding
    of what those of us who didn't own 3 homes before the Tubbs Fire are struggling
    with.
  - I ended up living out of my car for the last six months and have just moved into
    a room for rent which i found throguh my current employers. I am now working in
    a wine cellar, but the "internship" only lasts until November. I make 4 paychecks
    of $1100 which have to last me until March when I travel south for work again,
    which makes me enough money to move back here in time for another cellar position
    in August. I eat nutrigrain bars from the work pantry as my main caloric intake
    in the mornings. I have been cooking lentils and rice for most of my meals at
    home. Sometimes when I'm bored, I'll do the math to figure out how I can spend
    $3 on food that day instead of the usual $2 budget I give myself. I'm 6'5'' and
    am dropping weight and starting to lose my cognitive functions. Please let me
    partake in this help temporarily. All I know right now is that I need to eat,
    then I can figure out the rest. My parents are in no position to help financially
    as one is on disability in Modesto worst off than me, and the other just texted
    me that he's been worrking 30 days straight in the sun doing construction. He's
    60. I am 28, hoping to have enough to eat by my birthday coming up on the 8th
    of September. Whoever reads this, thank you.

    They call it a termination to avoid paying unemployment benefits, but our entire
    division was "fired" which consists of about six medics who were good at their
    jobs. We all got taken advantage of. I just need a little help while I look for
    another EMT job. I was on CalFresh about a year ago while I was a UC Davis student
    and now I need temporary help again. Medics are severely underpaid and the private
    EMS can be a tough business. We are are treated as disposable, unfortunately. '

  - 'I am applying for CalFresh because I am struggling to pay for food. I am currently
    going to college as a full time student, and I do not have full financial aid
    coverage. I rely on some money from my parents, but it is usually barely enough
    to pay for my tuition and rent. My parents income is less than middle class, and
    on top of that, they live in San Francisco, and almost everythign there is quite
    expensive, so they are also struggling to pay for their own necessities after
    rent. My mom was forced to quit her job just early this year because her lease
    for her store got terminated. I feel very bad having to ask them for money for
    food. I also had some personal and family struggles resulting in this, but I am
    determined to finish college within four years. '
