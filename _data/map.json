     -'I’m separated, going through divorce, not yet finalized. The ex-husband lost his job and I am looking for part-time work. I have two sons, both with ADHD, one with autism, and I spend a good amount of time parenting. Currently I just want to be able to feed them without building up debt on a credit card or depleting my savings account. My situation is embarrassing and humbling, but serious. If approved, I hope this will only be a temporary solution until I get on my feet, start a business, and rebuild my life.'

       -'I need help with many basic day to today activities of daily living, because I'm disabled and have great difficulty getting things done. I'm currently suffering of rheumatiod arthritis, fibromyalgia, and seizures. I'm also suffering of a severly injured back and possible some other disease that is causing me great abnormal weightloss and extreme fatigue. I'm currently working with my PCP to figure out what is causing it.'
      -'I am on various medications for endometriosis, bipolar disorder, etc. The cost of my copays for medications has skyrocketed. It is really important to stay on my medications. But that has made it hard to buy food that I’m supposed to be eating. Trying to make $30 last a week for groceries makes it really hard to buy vegetables and fruit. I have gone down two sizes in a month because I have been balancing the cost of my medications against my purchases of groceries.'
      -'I just moved out of my single-mother's house. I still help her with bills and also try to pay my own rent and utilities with the little money I could provide. I can only afford to work part-time because I am also in school and in the ROTC program. I would be very grateful to have some help with being able to buy nutritious food instead of settling for quick, unhealthy food such as ramen and hot dogs.'

  quotes:
       -'My husband walked out on me and my two kids a couple months ago and filed for divorce a month ago. He is still paying the mortgage and utilities but barely any for food and has otherwise cut me off financially. I started college two years ago to become a nurse and am still in school. I have used up what little money I had to enroll in school and get my kids started back to school. I am trying to sort out my situation and have some family help but have urgent need for food assistance and expect that to be the case for some time as my husband says he's not helping any further and I have a few years before I will be able to become a nurse, and school prohibits me from working full time. I am not eligible for unemployment as I have been home raising kids all these years.'
       -'I spend the majority of my money on food in Marin. This is because my hourly wage is so low in comparison to the cost of living. On top of it all, I am a wilderness first responder, and I work with youth outdoors as an environmental science educator. My job is to inspire hope, action, connection, and responsibility within our youth - however, my value is not reflected in pay, unfortunately - as teachers across America well know!'

       -'I am 18 years old. I got kicked out of my father’s household at 16 after many years of abuse throughout my life. My boyfriend and I work full time but struggle to make ends meet at times due to bills and overall the cost of living. We live downstairs in a friend's house. If I could receive help with monthly groceries that would be a huge help. Maybe we can soon move into our own apartment and start saving up money.'

They are both disabled and his home care worker shops and provides their food from their disability and retirement income. I purchase my own food due to a special diet. I am having surgery next week and will be home several weeks to recover.'
       -'I was a registered nurse until I fractured my right heel bone and was forced to retire. Disability was declined. The only income I have is Social Security ($1,047 per month). Each month, my expenses average $75 for major medical insurance, $80 for one prescription medication, $54 for auto insurance, $30 for auto registration, $250 for propane for cooking and heating (I live in a camper). I do not have dental insurance and can't afford to get care for my bad teeth. I really need help for food and other basic necessities.'
       -'I'm 25 and I take care of my grandma who has been on dialysis for 11 years. I’ve helped her everyday for several years for free. It has become increasingly hard to support myself with very little money and hardly any family support. I go to local churches and food drives to get food for my grandparents and myself. Unfortunately, I find that many days and nights I go hungry. I am extremely independent; seeking help for others is easy. For myself, I have trouble accepting anything I don't feel I earned, but everyone needs a little help to get on their feet sometimes. I don't intend to take advantage of CalFresh services for an extended period. Only until I find a job that can allow me flexible hours while my grandma needs my continued support.'

       -'I am an incoming sophomore student going into UCSB from Florida. My family's household earnings are dominated by my mother, who lives barely above the poverty line. We live in this house which is owned (mortgaged from bank) by my brother, who is in the military and has helped my mom pay for the expenses of me, herself, as well as our 70 year-old grandmother. Going into UCSB as an out of state student places a heavy burden of taking out around sixty-thousand dollars worth of loans in the first year (due to non-residency, and in-dorm housing rent). I support myself as an independent paying for a personal car insurance, as well as healthcare - in order to become a resident of California.'
       -'My mom passed away about three years ago and I have $8,000 saved up from her insurance that she gave to me which is how I have been able to manage school and living expenses. All that money will be gone in a couple of months with the rent here being so high. My dad just recently got a new job about two weeks ago after being unemployed for a very long time - I was responsible for helping him out until he got back up on his feet.'

Because of the time my dad spent in the hospital combined with the expenses of buying medication, I'm in a precarious position in affording the necessities of student life, like food every week. My Dad is dealing with depression along with a plethora of other health issues, which have affected his work. My Mom has also been having health issues of her own as she requires a cane due to her bad hip. I am part of the Educational Opportunity Program, which pointed me to CalFresh.'

       -'Until four weeks ago I had been working as an ambulance EMT, but I was laid off. They call it a termination to avoid paying unemployment benefits, but our entire division was "fired" which consists of about six medics who were good at their jobs. We all got taken advantage of. I just need a little help while I look for another EMT job.'
       -'As a college student without much money, trying to buy enough healthy food at the grocery store is a real challenge. I'd like to make healthier food choices and focus more on my academics and less on what I'll be able to eat everyday.'
       -'I am applying for CalFresh because I am struggling to pay for food. I am currently going to college as a full time student, and I do not have full financial aid coverage. I rely on some money from my parents, but it is usually barely enough to pay for my tuition and rent. My parents’ income is less than middle class, and on top of that, they live in San Francisco, and almost everything there is quite expensive, so they are also struggling to pay for their own necessities after rent. My mom was forced to quit her job just early this year because her lease for her store got terminated. I feel very bad having to ask them for money for food. I also had some personal and family struggles resulting in this, but I am determined to finish college within four years.'
       -'I am a full time student at UC Davis and babysit 15-20 hours a week depending on my schoolwork. Having food stamps throughout the next year would allow to me to focus on school and my future.'
       -'My parents can only offer limited support as they have 6 other children. For the most part I am solely responsible for ensuring my education, and right now I'm trying to budget things and food is definitely a concern.'
       -'Unfortunately, my parents had to move to another country because they couldn't afford to live here. I have no relatives or family around. I am attending UC Davis and I was supposed to receive financial aid but they haven't completed my package. It's been really hard to pay for everything by myself since I'm a student and can't work full time.'
       -'I am a student and am looking for a job. My parents are struggling to pay for my tuition as well as my rent because they have a whole list of their own debts that they're still trying to pay off. I would like to contribute as much as possible to my rent and tuition. CalFresh would help me eat quality food without worrying about breaking the bank. Anything helps.'

I'm trying to meet the requirements to get my license in CA for my profession and am almost done, so I can start looking for work. I move into my new place in/around the 10th-15th of Oct., where the rent will be $1995/mo. My parents are helping as much as they can and I receive unemployment until I find work, but I'm not bringing in much.'
      -'I said that I have a disability and I wanted to elaborate. I have a brain tumor that has left half of my throat and mouth paralyzed. Because of this, I must keep my immune system in top shape and I consider healthy food to be medicine. I am applying for food stamps because healthy foods are expensive and I can't afford them on my own.'

      -'Currently, I am looking for a job near my apartment but even with that money I would earn, I still have to pay rent, utilities, and still go to college next month.'
      -'I have extensive health problems. Due to serious food sensitivities, my diet is very expensive. If I eat food that's come in contact with wheat, corn, or tapioca I will vomit for days. This rules most cheap meal options out. Additionally, I have PTSD and ADHD, which require expensive ongoing medication. My ongoing costs include $150 or so for therapy, which I cannot go without, about $600 for health insurance, paying down a $900 credit card bill, and soon I may need to replace the computer that is my livelihood as far as job hunting goes. I want to save as much as I can so I can move into a rented room when I find a job. I have no family to fall back on. I legally emancipated from my mother at 16 due to abuse, and my father is dead.'
      -'I have not been able to work for the past three months. Due to medical reasons, I cannot stand for long periods of time. I am self-employed so if I don't work I don't make an income. I'm hoping to have a medical procedure so I can return to work in the next couple of months. My partner has been actively looking for work but he has been my primary caregiver, which has limited his schedule over the past couple of months.'
      -'I attend a computer science program that offers a tuition Income Share Agreement (ISA). That means I'll give them nearly 30% of my pay once I'm employed, and living assistance ISA to pay for tuition and living costs, so I applied for both this year. Finding part-time work would be difficult - classes are from 9:30AM to 5:20PM on weekdays and our weekends are for working on projects and building our portfolios.'
      -'I am a full-time PhD student at UCSF. The past few months, after a string of unexpected expenses have caused my credit debt to build, I have found it hard to make ends meet and I haven't been able to save any money to pay my taxes. This has left me very vulnerable and has caused a great deal of stress. Beyond this, I am not allowed to seek outside employment while I am enrolled at UCSF, and I am expected to spend 40-60 hours a week conducting research in a lab.'

     -'I send my mother $175 every month. She uses it for food, bills, and other basic necessities for herself and my younger sister. This takes away the money that I could use for my own groceries.'

      -'I'm a recent graduate and I'm currently unemployed, but actively applying for jobs. Once I secure employment, I will pay a small amount for rent to my parents as well as make sure I pay my fines ($2200) to the Sonoma Court County. Obtaining food stamps will greatly alleviate my financial burden.'

I have not found fulltime work, despite a 4 year college business degree and 35 years of experience, since 2008. All resources meant for retirement have had to be used, and are depleted. Until last summer, I had paid all my bills on time for 35 years. Bankruptcy is scheduled next month. The car goes to repo tomorrow. I have HIV and am disabled depending on which social service or doctor you talk to, and am unable to get SSI. I am unable to get a job interview for full-time anything, all in my 50's. Well, it was damn good until 2008. Thank you for letting me vent a little. So glad I didn't have a mortgage, or children. I would have been a great dad.'

I am still disabled it has only been since August end of the month that I was released. I cannot pay my rent, copays for oncologist. After 3 hours of light activity I get very exhausted and my body aches. I have back lumbar pain and still recovering from two surgeries to remove the cancer.

I barely got by. I am almost embarrassed to be here, but hey, it happens, and I know I am not alone. First and foremost, my son needs to know that food will always be available.'

     -'After taking six weeks of paid family leave to care for my ailing husband, my employer said there was no work for me. I applied for unemployment benefits, which I received and am currently on. Once my husband passed away, we stopped receiving his disability benefits and can't pay for rent and utilities.'
     -'I have a worker’s compensation claim. I have now been switched to Permanent Disability and that amount is only $580 every 2 weeks. This has left me in a really bad place. At this time, I am waiting for a hearing on my case. I am in limbo but in the meantime my family is suffering due to this hardship. I am a hard working person who has been off work since May 2017! I am in depression!'
      -'My son had a heart attack and open heart surgery. He cannot work and needs home care for a few months. I am financially unable to take care of both of us. He moved in with me about 8 months ago and did odd jobs for money. I was doing occasional caregiver jobs for extra income but now neither one of us can work and the rent increased when he moves in with me.'

    -'I won't receive income until I am approved for disability insurance so I have an account balance of zero dollars. My significant other (whom I live with and share the bills) suffered from a compound fracture in her ankle two days ago. She had to have surgery to reinforce her bones with metal plates and screws. She will be discharged today. The doctor is not allowing her to work for four to six weeks and she only has $600 in her bank account.'
    -'I am currently a graduate student and will soon be moving to San Diego. Since I am moving I was forced to quit my job. Unfortunately, my mother lost her job a few years back and is unable to support me financially. My father, who now lives in Texas, is also unable to support me. The financial aid I have received from school only covers money for tuition, books, rent, and utilities. I currently don't have the income to purchase food, toiletries, and other necessary items. Receiving an EBT card would lift a large weight off my shoulders, I could focus more on my education rather than how I'm going to make ends meet each month.'
      -'I am on workers comp. The last 2 months have been hard food wise. My husband's mom sends cash from Russia to help with our rent and my brothers are loaning me money to cover my bills until I get my settlement and can pay them back but it leaves us with only about $150 for food every month for 2 people.'
      -'We relocated to be closer to family because of our health problems, but we have been unable to secure any permanent housing yet. We’re going broke paying for nightly budget motels which double their rates every weekend. We will most likely be living in our car starting tomorrow until my wife's next social security check comes in next week. We’ll go back to a motel until we can secure housing. I am disabled with COPD and require medical oxygen and a sleep apnea machine, my wife has renal failure and is confined to a wheelchair.'
      -'My school referred me to CalFresh. I am a senior in college and live on my own. As rewarding as that feels, at the end of the day, I do struggle a lot with paying bills and still having money left over to buy food. No one else supports me, so with the little money I have left over I am normally only able to afford unhealthy meals. If I were to have the opportunity to receive some type of financial assistance, I feel that I would be able to be a heathier person and feel better throughout the day while studying.'
      -'I spend about $200 on groceries and another $200 on car insurance. My commute to work is 40 miles every day, and it takes about $50 to fill my tank every week ($100 every pay period). I work & I work hard, but I can't do this on my own. I'm tired of just surviving, I'm ready to start thriving. I'm making progress to where I want to be in life, but right now I need some help. Sometimes my roommates eat my food while I'm away at work, so what was supposed to last me a couple of days only lasted a night. I can't afford to keep buying groceries, so I'm just about living off of multi-vitamins & protein shakes. Even if you can't help me, thank you for taking the time to look at my case, & I hope you're having a great day when you read this.'
      -'As my children are getting older, they are consuming more. Their father, who lives in Colorado, will not increase his monthly child support payments to help cover costs as our children get older. I am a self-employed single mother and in addition have now have taken on the caregiver role for my elderly folks, one with dementia and the other who recently had a brain injury. I am not able to make ends meet. Receiving CalFresh benefits would greatly help my situation.'

      -'My unemployment ran out in April. I am under a one year lease. My son works where I used to work, and he has the only income for the family. The rent is all of our income. My other children are in college full time and there is no work-study this year. They are on grants for their academics through PELL and SEOG. I really want someone who can evaluate our situation and provide resources. Thank you.'
      -'Not sure if this helps at all. The last time I had to renew my CalFresh all I needed to do was to update and give some paperwork and I kept forgetting, just like I forget a lot of things and stress about them. I struggle from paycheck to paycheck and at times I do ask my parents for money or food especially because my daughter is growing and eating more. We do live in a low income housing and we qualify for the HEAP program for our PGE. I do go to the food bank when I can which is a big help but we still need help with other foods.'
      -'I was working full time at a large hotel in Monterey. I had good pay, but was offered a job at a local business for higher pay and Monday to Friday (since hotels are open 24/7, a Monday to Friday schedule seemed like a luxury). The hiring job asked me to put in my two weeks’ notice for my past job. I was already training for my new job when they called me and said the position wouldn't work out since they didn't have it in the budget. Now I'm unemployed and applying for jobs.'
      -'Our income is around $3,000 per month, but it gets expensive with credit card bills, auto insurance, gas, clothes, diapers, utility bills, repairing the old car, etc. At times we cannot keep up with affording food. So we spend $8 for four people on McDonalds or boiling potatoes with salt is what we have to do to survive.'
      -'I have a car payment that's $336 every month and a weekly daycare bill of $175. After rent, the phone bill, and gas, I have nearly nothing to spend on food. I often don't eat so that my child can eat. I feel terrible feeding him cheap unhealthy food, especially because I enjoy cooking, but I can't afford the ingredients to cook anything. It's embarrassing, but I often eat leftover food at work or the school cafeteria so I have the energy to function. I would absolutely appreciate any help I can get.'

I am waiting until age 66 (my full retirement age for social security) because I will need the bit of extra money that I'll receive by waiting. I have never asked for help before and neither has anyone in my immediate family, and I have a bit of shame about applying for this food assistance, but I've been urged by a medical provider to not be so proud and to apply for some short term assistance.'

I am trying to further my future by earning a degree to one day be financially stable and available to help others in need.'
      -'This is my 2nd year at CSU Chico and during my first year I had no problems with money as my financial aid covered most of it, the rest was barely paid for by my parents. I found out last year after multiple visits to the financial aid office that for the rest of my education that I will not be getting almost any financial aid. It was for the reason that my parents just barely made the line of which to receive financial aid and so I ended up getting $750 (in grants) this year instead of the $12,000 (in grants) from last year. My dad works as a construction worker and it's only on certain weeks that he gets paid good which ends up making it like we have money but in reality, the pay is inconsistent. Anyways seeing this my parents and friends have told me to drop out but I really did not want to give up on college. I am looking for a job to help cover my expenses.'

We have done our best to keep our cost of living as low as possible but do have an additional $700 of expenses on top of the $1400 we spend on rent.'
      -'I was married when I came out of the closet. I couldn't get out of the marriage even though my wife long knew that I was gay so I went to my mom's. My mom couldn't accept me being gay, nor could my siblings. I left for the Bay Area. I originally planned to pay the bills driving for Uber, but my car was stolen. I have a new job, but need to wait two weeks before getting paid so I can buy basic things like food.'
     -'I'm struggling really bad, to the point of being in debt. I never have enough to eat. Ramen noodles, eggs, cereal everyday, just to save up money for bills. I've been going to the hospital to see what is wrong with me, but I believe I just need to eat properly. I'm almost 22 now, and I have another year of school. I honestly don't know how I will make it if I have no family here.'
     -'I am currently applying for grad school, which is extremely expensive. We are still living in Berkeley even though we both graduated. The rent is extremely high here and we receive absolutely no financial assistance from our parents. Since we graduated from UC Berkeley this past summer, we are also no longer receiving financial aid, which has significantly impacted our ability to support ourselves. We both now work in San Francisco and transportation to and from the city every day is quite costly. We are struggling to find the extra funds to feed ourselves after paying for rent, utilities, public transit, loans, grad school applications, and everything in between.'
      -'I do not receive any financial support from my father, and my mother works tirelessly in two jobs to feed my younger brother and to help me with college. I help my mom pay the water, light and gas bills for our apartment back in southern California, and I also pay the water, gas, and light bills for my apartment here in Berkeley. Our financial situation is not the best, and a CalFresh card would be a huge blessing and support.'
      -'I work twice a week, which is the most that I can work with my school schedule. Last semester was very hard. I would either have class all day, or have class and get off and work, or on weekends I would work. I did not have a single day off for 4 months straight to skim by. I would have to choose between eating or school supplies. This is affecting my mental and physical health. I hope that I can make this year better, and be excited for school, not dread it...'
      -'I'm in medical school and am taking out ~$33,000 in loans every four months. I'm spending more than half of my loan money on rent and utilities. Since I'm in medical school, I have to do volunteer work to gain more knowledge and skills in order to be the best doctor I can become. I have no time outside of this to work for money, or else I'd be jeopardizing my education. Because of the high cost of living in the Bay Area, I'm struggling to pay for groceries, basic living expenses, and car insurance so that I can get to and from the clinic I'm volunteering in at Martinez. I do not buy as much food as I need because of the expenses of living and the books/technology/transportation costs required for me to learn medicine.'

     -'I lost my home in the Tubbs Fire. All of my money that I did receive from FEMA went to hotel costs. After couch surfing for six months, I finally found a friend who had a room opening up. Unfortunately I had spent everything on hotel costs, rental applications, and simply trying to get my life back together. I have nothing left. I need help. I'm putting myself in debt because I thought now would be a good time to see a dentist after seven years... I figure no one is going to actually read this anyway, so it's mostly just venting. Maybe I'll get lucky, and whoever's in charge of my case will at least understanding what those of us who didn't own three homes before the Tubbs Fire are struggling with.'

My father is 69 years old and permanently disabled due to osteoporosis. I am currently a full-time student at the Cal State here and also work a part-time job. There is not enough income in my home for us to get the proper nutrition we all need.

My mother is also diabetic, so she too requires a special diet.'

He had benefits, but when he became 18, they said he doesn’t qualify anymore. I disagree. I've been wanting to reapply for him but haven’t had the chance. Since we have moved to Sacramento, I haven't been able to work a steady job because of my disease. I can't afford to support my adult son because I also have two younger children that I support on my own. My son is crashing with family or friends, but doesn’t have a stable place to live. I try to take him food to eat when I can. I don’t know what else to do.'
     -'I have been working as an appraiser for 16 years, but since moving to Sacramento, I haven't been able to find work. A couple weeks ago, my annual software fees were due as well as my business insurance, and I was unable to pay. This has shut down my business. I am looking for work. I am selling things in order to survive on a daily basis. I anticipate this request for food stamps to be temporary. I look forward to getting back on my feet soon but some assistance, especially food assistance, would help immensely.'

A recent illness caused my condition to worsen. I need help.'
     -'I pay for wifi also and I take care of my emotional support dog Charlotte who is about 35 lbs. So any extra funds I have left goes to feeding and keeping her groomed. I can't walk to food pantries and such as they are too far. I get help from friends or neighbors with a hot meal here and there. I am starving almost after the first week after payday and I am becoming more unhealthy. I do not know what else to do. I am hungry now as I am typing this.'
     -'As I mentioned before, my father abandoned my family and I about 3 some-odd years ago. Not only was he a major financial help to the family, but he was a great emotional support as well. Since then, we have tried our best to cope with the losses, both emotionally and financially. My sister and I work retail jobs and are the main sources of income, but even our pooled finances do NOT cover bills, rent, and food. (My mother is disabled and cannot work.) Even with SSI, most of the money goes towards rent and bills. Often, we have to go without food for several days at a time or ask to borrow, lots of times without success. I know that you get a lot of sob stories on these types of platforms, but for whomever is reading, I ask that you go over my case and help my family and I as best as you can. It has not been easy, but we are doing our part.'

I make about $900 a month, but $500 goes to rent, $120 goes to phone bills and the other is gas and groceries. Most the time I under pay the rent by up to $200.
