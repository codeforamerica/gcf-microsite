          At Code for America, we run GetCalFresh.org, which helps more than
          20,000 households apply for food assistance every month. We know that
          it's very difficult to overcome stigma and seek out help, even for
          people who are experiencing hunger. Despite their hardships, many of
          our users still feel compelled to describe the reluctance, and often
          shame, they feel about asking for help. They might mention they waited
          too long to apply, they have never asked for help before, or they hope
          to be off of food assistance as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stigma our users experience arises from myths about food
          assistance, which have a deep resonance in American culture. It only
          takes an occasional sensational anecdote for these myths to persist.
          Through this site, we will counteract those myths with real stories
          from GetCalFresh applicants, in their own words, that ground us in the
          facts about food assistance. We'll showcase real, representative
          stories of people seeking and receiving assistance, as well as
          relevant findings from rigorous research. We know that, as one of our
          users put it, "the less fortunate are invisible to so many people."
          Our aim is to surface their stories, with dignity and respect, and to
          make them visible.

          Most GetCalFresh users were barely making ends meet when they were
          tipped into crisis by an unexpected expense or job loss.<a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/SNAPFoodSec.pdf"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
          The first set of stories on this site exemplify the precarious financial
          lives of many Californians. Once cost of living is taken into account,
          California is the state with the highest poverty rate.<a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-258.pdf"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The second set of stories describes common shocks or adverse events
          that lead people to apply for food assistance. An illness, injury,
          loss of a job, a rent increase, or even a car breakdown might be
          enough to force a financially vulnerable household to begin making
          choices between food and other necessities.
