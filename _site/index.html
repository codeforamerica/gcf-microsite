            <h2>A fresh look at the facts</h2>
            <p>
              Californians who receive food assistance come from all
              backgrounds, but many share a similar story: they were already
              struggling with financial <strong>instability</strong> when they
              experienced a <strong>common shock</strong>. CalFresh helps people
              through challenging times in their lives. This site shares their
              stories.

            At Code for America, we run GetCalFresh.org, which helps more than
            20,000 households apply for <span id="food-assistance-callout" class="callout">food assistance</span>
            every month. We know that it's very difficult to overcome stigma and
            seek out help, even for people who are experiencing hunger. Despite
            their hardships, many of our users still feel compelled to describe
            the reluctance, and often shame, they feel about asking for help. They
            might mention they waited too long to apply, they have never asked for
            help before, or they hope to be off of food assistance as quickly as
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stigma our users experience arises from myths about food
            assistance, which have a deep resonance in American culture. It only
            takes an occasional sensational anecdote for these myths to persist.
            Through this site, we will counteract those myths with real stories
            from GetCalFresh applicants, in their own words, that ground us in the
            facts about food assistance. We'll showcase real, representative
            stories of people seeking and receiving assistance, as well as
            relevant findings from rigorous research. We know that, as one of our
            users put it, "the less fortunate are invisible to so many people."
            Our aim is to surface their stories, with dignity and respect, and to
            make them visible.

            enough to force a financially vulnerable household to begin making
            choices between food and other necessities.

            Food assistance is a way of coping with a challenge that almost
            everyone is familiar with: making ends meet. Despite its size and
            economic diversity, California is the fourth most expensive place to
            live in the country, after Hawaii, Washington DC, and New York. While
            eligibility for SNAP is based on the federal poverty line (which is
            the same across all states) Californians has the fourth highest cost
            of living in the nation.<a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/prices-inflation/regional-price-parities-state-and-metro-area"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

            These economic circumstances mean that many people have no buffer if
            they suddenly incur a large expense or lose income. It is not
            surprising that the most common dilemma GetCalFresh applicants mention
            in their applications is not being able to afford food after paying
            for rent, utilities, and gas or public transit fare to get to work.
            <strong>In their applications for food assistance, about three in
            five of our applicants report having less than $100 on hand after
            monthly expenses.</strong>

            Most of the people receiving CalFresh benefits who can work, do work.
            But they often work in low-wage jobs like retail, the restaurant
            industry, home health, or construction. These jobs often have unsteady
            hours that can leave workers in financially unstable situations. They
            also lack benefits and flexibility, which can mean frequent job losses
            and gaps between jobs if transportation or child care falls through.
            When food assistance is taken away from parents, that means fewer
            groceries, which negatively impacts the health of the whole family.

            Despite their efforts, parents often struggle to provide healthy food
            for their kids. The median GetCalFresh parent works 38 hours a week,
            earning $14.70 an hour. In fact, 66% of GetCalFresh households with
            children include someone who is working. Nationally, 65% of SNAP

            The testimonials of these parents echo the research findings. In
            interviews with 90 families with children receiving SNAP benefits,
            academics found that about half restricted their own eating to make sure
            their children would have enough food.footnote In the U.S. in 2017,
            15.7% of households with children were food insecure.<a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            In about 45% of these households (or 7% of all U.S. households), adults

            Students often take desperate measures to stay fed: they join clubs
            for the food, participate in research for cash, and ask friends to
            swipe them into the dining hall. In some counties, a large share of
            the applicants GetCalFresh sees are students. For example, students
            account for 60.7% of applications in Santa Cruz County and 58% of
            applications in Yolo County.

            For recent high school or college grads entering the workforce,
            CalFresh serves as a bridge that gets them through the least secure,
            lowest-paid time of their careers. This is easy to see in the data:
            GetCalFresh applicants below age 30 work four fewer hours a week,
            and earn two dollars less per hour, than applicants in their thirties
            (the latter work a median of 36 hours a week at $15 per hour).
            Moreover, 46.1% of applicants under age 30 live by themselves,

          <h3>Many seniors need help buying food, but are especially affected by stigma</h3>
          <p>
            Saving enough to have a stable retirement income is more and more
            challenging these days. Seniors, who are often on this kind of fixed
            income, can especially benefit from food assistance. Yet they
            represent the population with the greatest gap between their
            eligibility for CalFresh and their enrollment in the program, due in
            large part to stigma. <a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            Perhaps unsurprisingly, many GetCalFresh applicants who are seniors
            describe a recent job loss or seeking employment as a reason for
            applying.

      I do not qualify for social security until I turn 66 in 2020. I just
filed for unemployment and am currently searching for work, as I have a
mortgage and bills to pay. I am drawing on my retirement savings to pay
living expenses while I am out of work. The EDD monthly payment is to be
about $380, and I have not yet received payment. Jobs I am interviewing
for are offering as low as $13 per hour. I have, therefore, reluctantly
applied for this food aid program due to the high cost of living in

            Up to this point, we've focused on stories from some of our largest
            groups of applicants: working families, students or young people
            starting their careers, and seniors. They convey stress. Their
            households have no slack in their incomes — they already cannot keep
            up with the bare necessities. A single car accident, medical
            emergency, or unexpected layoff can break the budget for months, often
            forcing them to choose between food, housing, or medical care. In this
            section, we examine some of the common shocks that lead already
            vulnerable individuals to seek out CalFresh.

            Academic researchers lump shocks that lead to food (and financial)
            insecurity into simple categories: as sharp increases in expenses or
            reductions in income.<a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/SNAPFoodSec.pdf"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00713.x"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            In this section, we'll describe a few of the more common shocks our
            applicants describe. They include losing a job, the high costs of
            illness or injury, or having to stay home to take care of a family
            member. Natural disasters, while less frequent, can also be a shock -
            in recent months, thousands of people have applied due to being
            displaced by California's wildfires.

            People who apply for food assistance often have experienced a
            hardship that causes them to slip into poverty. Roughly 2 in 5
            households that fall into poverty do so because of the loss of a job.
            Nearly half (47%) of households that exit poverty will do so because
            of a new job. <a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

            When transitioning between jobs, CalFresh reduces stress around food
            availability and the pressure to make costly trade-offs to get by.
            Clients share stories about dire choices they have to make like
            selling a car in a rush or using rent money for food and being
            evicted. The most common reason applicants tell us for no longer
            needing food assistance is that they went from unemployed to employed,
            found a better job, or got more hours. CalFresh provides the stability
            to find more regular hours, or a higher paying job.

            California is prone to natural disasters like fires, droughts, and
            earthquakes. The impact of disaster on low-income communities can be
            catastrophic and reveal how many people were financially insecure.
            They may have had enough money to get by, but limited insurance or a
            very small rainy day fund. Many are forced to use already limited
            assets to buffer losses like moving to a new area to find a job or
            home to rent. Following a disaster, aid normally comes in the form of
            FEMA, unemployment insurance, and food assistance. People who were
            better off financially often recover more quickly, while others need
            more support to get back on their feet.

      I am at an age of neither a senior citizen nor a person with a career and
in her forties but, rather in my late fifties. My story is this: I had a
great job, went out on a surgery to fix an injury that occured from work.
Upon being out, they laid me off after 14 years of service. I then took
from my 401(k) to continue my house payments, only to drain my retirement
and still end up losing my home to the loan sharks and banks who preyed
upon people such as myself. Upon losing my job, my home, and my
retirement, I was left with nothing but a vehicle and I turned to the
street. I am grateful to the folks at CalFresh, I can literally say I was
starving and have never experienced that before, not only did it open my
eyes to the homeless and less fortunate, but I actually used a service
that was there for people in my situation and that I am grateful for. I am
thankful that you people saw it as an emergency to get me my card. Wow —
the system worked in my favor for a change! Although I'm saddened by
having learned that the less fortunate are invisible to so many people.
I've now been on the other side of the fence, and I am still in shock how
badly people treat others who don't have anything, like we are not there.
My heart pours out to those who truly want a better life but just can't
pull themselves out of the whirlpool. Bitter and grateful at same time.
Thank you for the help. A full stomach or warm coffee made the world a
better place to look at.

My story is this: I had a\ngreat job, went out on a surgery to fix an injury that occured from work.\nUpon being out, they laid me off after 14 years of service. I then took\nfrom my 401(k) to continue my house payments, only to drain my retirement\nand still end up losing my home to the loan sharks and banks who preyed\nupon people such as myself. Upon losing my job, my home, and my\nretirement, I was left with nothing but a vehicle and I turned to the\nstreet. I am grateful to the folks at CalFresh, I can literally say I was\nstarving and have never experienced that before, not only did it open my\neyes to the homeless and less fortunate, but I actually used a service\nthat was there for people in my situation and that I am grateful for. I am\nthankful that you people saw it as an emergency to get me my card. Wow —\nthe system worked in my favor for a change! Although I'm saddened by\nhaving learned that the less fortunate are invisible to so many people.\nI've now been on the other side of the fence, and I am still in shock how\nbadly people treat others who don't have anything, like we are not there.\nMy heart pours out to those who truly want a better life but just can't\npull themselves out of the whirlpool. Bitter and grateful at same time.\nThank you for the help. A full stomach or warm coffee made the world a\nbetter place to look at.\n","byline":"San Diego"},{"quote":"After being laid-off and on unemployment benefits my main concern was to\ncover rent as the first priority and food as the second priority. CalFresh\nhelped with food which allowed me to put other monies toward rent. I was\nable to get fresh produce at my local mom and pop market which accepts EBT\nand it was very convenient. I also felt that by trying to stretch the\ndollar further I was eating a little healthier. I am thankful for the\nassistance.\n","byline":"San Francisco"},{"quote":"At first I was embarrassed to ask for help. After I realized I would not\nhave enough money to eat, I applied for help from CalFresh based on the\nadvice from a friend. I'm glad I did, because the help I received made all\nthe difference in the world. It took away the tremendous stress I've was\nunder, and the utter despair I was feeling, and allowed me the time I\nneeded to get back on my feet.\n","byline":"Marin"},{"quote":"CalFresh eased some of the troubles in my mind. With CalFresh, I did not\nhave to worry about where the next meal will be coming from since I am\nstill actively looking for a job. All I had to do was go to the nearest\ngrocery which supports EBT, pick and choose food items from the major food\ngroups, and cook! Thank you, CalFresh, you are a lifesaver. My kids and I\ncannot thank this program enough.\n","byline":"San Diego"},{"quote":"I lost my job and unemployment, went through all my savings paying for my\nplace to live and bills. I stripped down to the bare necessities. The\npanic and uncertainty is completely debilitating! CalFresh has helped me\nto be able to have a little security knowing I can eat.\n","byline":"San Diego"},{"quote":"I started college for a career change, my car broke down, and then I lost\nmy job. I really didn't want to get on CalFresh because of my pride but\nhad no choice. Thanks to CalFresh, I get to eat a healthy meal every night\nand am now back in college.\n","byline":"Fresno"},{"quote":"We were going through a crisis after my husband became disabled and could\nno longer work. CalFresh enabled us to continue to eat well even when we\nwere not sure how we were going to pay our bills. Things are going much\nbetter now, but I am grateful every day for the help.\n","byline":"Marin"},{"quote":"I would have had many hungry nights without CalFresh. After paying the\nbills, I only have a few dollars left. With CalFresh, I didn't have to\ndecide whether I was walking to work in the early morning or skipping\ndinner.\n","byline":"Fresno"},{"quote":"I am a freelancer here in the San Diego area and I don't always get a\nmonthly income. There were a few days I had to skip meals in order to save\nfor something substantial. But after being on CalFresh, I can walk into\nthe grocery store with confidence that, yes, I can afford that salad.\n","byline":"San Diego"}]};
