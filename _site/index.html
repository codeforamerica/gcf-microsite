            <h2>The stories behind the numbers</h2>
            <p>
              Californians who receive food assistance come from all
              backgrounds, but many share a similar story: they were
              <strong>barely getting by</strong> financially when they were
              <strong>tipped into a crisis</strong> by an unexpected expense or
              loss of income. This site shares their stories.

            At Code for America, we run GetCalFresh.org, which helps more than
            30,000 households apply for <span title="#" class="callout">food
            assistance</span> every month. <strong>We've heard again and again
            how difficult it is for people experiencing hunger to seek out
            help.</strong> Despite their hardships, many of our users describe
            their reluctance to ask for help. Many tell us that they have never
            asked for help before and are ashamed about their situation.
            Applicants feel the stigma that arises from deeply ingrained myths
            about poverty and welfare in American culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our users' stories challenge these myths.</strong> They
            reflect the common financial struggles that lead people to seek out
            food assistance. We know that, as one of our users put it, "The less
            fortunate are invisible to so many people." Our aim is to surface
            their stories, with dignity and respect, in order to create a more
            accurate and memorable picture of the people who seek out and
            receive food assistance in California.

 Many Californians &mdash;
            working adults, families with children, students, seniors &mdash;
            live precarious financial lives, described in the stories in the

            A financial shock, such as an illness or injury, a job loss, a rent
            increase, or even a car breakdown, might be enough to force a
            financially vulnerable household to make choices between food and
            other necessities. <a class="intLink" href="#shocks">The second
            section of this site</a> includes stories of adverse events that led
            Californians to seek out food assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The reason people feel shame in asking for help is that they
            prefer to be self-sufficient.</strong> A common goal among users is
            to be on CalFresh for the shortest possible time. Others mention
            anxiety that friends, extended family, or employers might find out
            that they are seeking food assistance.

          After taxes, insurance, union dues, and retirement contributions, I only
take home $1,020 every two weeks. My rent is $1,200. I have worked all my
life, never been unemployed, and never requested assistance before. I have
been with Sheriff's Department and Probation for almost 25 years, and I
still make the same amount I did when I started all those years ago. The
price of everything continues to go up but my pay continues to go down. We
struggle every month just to make it. <strong>I hate to ask for
assistance, but I don't know what else to do.</strong>

the equivalent of 8,900 full-time jobs.

            everyone is familiar with: making ends meet. Despite its size and
            economic diversity, California is the fourth most expensive place to

            lowest-paid time of their careers. This is easy to see in the data:
            GetCalFresh applicants below age 30 work four fewer hours a week,
            and earn two dollars less per hour, than applicants in their thirties
            (the latter work a median of 36 hours a week at $15 per hour).
            Moreover, 46.1% of applicants under age 30 live by themselves,
            compared to only 28.5% of applicants in their thirties.<a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

          <h3>Many seniors need help buying food, but are especially affected by stigma</h3>
          <p>
            Saving enough to have a stable retirement income is more and more
            challenging these days. Seniors, who are often on this kind of fixed
            income, can especially benefit from food assistance. Yet they
            represent the population with the greatest gap between their
            eligibility for CalFresh and their enrollment in the program, due in
            large part to stigma. <a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            Perhaps unsurprisingly, many GetCalFresh applicants who are seniors

            applying.

filed for unemployment and am currently searching for work, as I have a

            Up to this point, we've focused on stories from some of our largest
            groups of applicants: working families, students or young people
            starting their careers, and seniors. They convey stress. Their
            households have no slack in their incomes — they already cannot keep
            up with the bare necessities. A single car accident, medical
            emergency, or unexpected layoff can break the budget for months, often
            forcing them to choose between food, housing, or medical care. In this
            section, we examine some of the common shocks that lead already
            vulnerable individuals to seek out CalFresh.

            Academic researchers lump shocks that lead to food (and financial)
            insecurity into simple categories: as sharp increases in expenses or
            reductions in income.<a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/SNAPFoodSec.pdf"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00713.x"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            In this section, we'll describe a few of the more common shocks our
            applicants describe. They include losing a job, the high costs of
            illness or injury, or having to stay home to take care of a family
            member. Natural disasters, while less frequent, can also be a shock -
            in recent months, thousands of people have applied due to being
            displaced by California's wildfires.

            People who apply for food assistance often have experienced a
            hardship that causes them to slip into poverty. Roughly 2 in 5
            households that fall into poverty do so because of the loss of a job.
            Nearly half (47%) of households that exit poverty will do so because
            of a new job. <a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

            When transitioning between jobs, CalFresh reduces stress around food
            availability and the pressure to make costly trade-offs to get by.
            Clients share stories about dire choices they have to make like
            selling a car in a rush or using rent money for food and being
            evicted. The most common reason applicants tell us for no longer
            needing food assistance is that they went from unemployed to employed,
            found a better job, or got more hours. CalFresh provides the stability
            to find more regular hours, or a higher paying job.

          <p>
            California is prone to natural disasters like fires, droughts, and
            earthquakes. The impact of disaster on low-income communities can be
            catastrophic and reveal how many people were financially insecure.
            They may have had enough money to get by, but limited insurance or a
            very small rainy day fund. Many are forced to use already limited
            assets to buffer losses like moving to a new area to find a job or
            home to rent. Following a disaster, aid normally comes in the form of
            FEMA, unemployment insurance, and food assistance. People who were
            better off financially often recover more quickly, while others need
            more support to get back on their feet.

          I lost my home in the Tubbs Fire. All of my money that I did receive
from FEMA went to hotel costs. After couch surfing for six months, I
finally found a friend who had a room opening up. Unfortunately I had
spent everything on hotel costs, rental applications, and simply trying
to get my life back together. I have nothing left. I need help. I'm
putting myself in debt because I thought now would be a good time to see
a dentist after seven years...I figure no one is going to actually read
this anyway, so it's mostly just venting. Maybe I'll get lucky, and
whoever's in charge of my case will at least understanding what those of
us who didn't own three homes before the Tubbs Fire are struggling with.

            In California, a state with one of the highest costs of living in the
            country, nearly one in five people live in poverty. CalFresh helps
            millions of California workers in low-paying jobs buy healthy food
            during a time of need. CalFresh doesn't only help an individual make
            it through a difficult time, but also energizes the local economy.

          I am at an age of neither a senior citizen nor a person with a career and
in her forties but, rather in my late fifties. My story is this: I had a
great job, went out on a surgery to fix an injury that occured from work.
Upon being out, they laid me off after 14 years of service. I then took
from my 401(k) to continue my house payments, only to drain my retirement
and still end up losing my home to the loan sharks and banks who preyed
upon people such as myself. Upon losing my job, my home, and my
retirement, I was left with nothing but a vehicle and I turned to the
street. I am grateful to the folks at CalFresh, I can literally say I was
starving and have never experienced that before, not only did it open my
eyes to the homeless and less fortunate, but I actually used a service
that was there for people in my situation and that I am grateful for. I am
thankful that you people saw it as an emergency to get me my card. Wow —
the system worked in my favor for a change! Although I'm saddened by
having learned that the less fortunate are invisible to so many people.
I've now been on the other side of the fence, and I am still in shock how
badly people treat others who don't have anything, like we are not there.
My heart pours out to those who truly want a better life but just can't
pull themselves out of the whirlpool. Bitter and grateful at same time.
Thank you for the help. A full stomach or warm coffee made the world a
better place to look at.
