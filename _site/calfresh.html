          I am at an age of neither a senior citizen nor a person with a career
          and in her forties but, rather in my late fifties. My story is this: I
          had a great job, went out on a surgery to fix an injury that occured
          from work. Upon being out, they laid me off after 14 years of service.
          I then took from my 401(k) to continue my house payments, only to
          drain my retirement and still end up losing my home to the loan sharks
          and banks who preyed upon people such as myself. Upon losing my job,
          my home, and my retirement, I was left with nothing but a vehicle and
          I turned to the street. I am grateful to the folks at CalFresh, I can
          literally say I was starving and have never experienced that before,
          not only did it open my eyes to the homeless and less fortunate, but I
          actually used a service that was there for people in my situation and
          that I am grateful for. I am thankful that you people saw it as an
          emergency to get me my card. Wow - the system worked in my favor for a
          change! Although I'm saddened by having learned that the less
          fortunate are invisible to so many people. I've now been on the other
          side of the fence, and I am still in shock how badly people treat
          others who don't have anything, like we are not there. My heart pours
          out to those who truly want a better life but just can't pull
          themselves out of the whirlpool. Bitter and grateful at same time.
          Thank you for the help. A full stomach or warm coffee made the world a
          better place to look at.
